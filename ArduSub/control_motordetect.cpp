/*
 * control_motordetect.cpp - init and run calls for motordetect flightmode;
 *
 *  This mode pulses all thrusters to detect if they need to be reversed.
 *  This still requires that the user has the correct frame selected and the motors
 *  are connected to the correct ESCs.
 *
 *  For each motor:
 *      wait until vehicle is stopped for > 500ms
 *      apply throttle up for 500ms
 *      If results are good:
 *          save direction and try the next motor.
 *      else
 *          wait until vehicle is stopped for > 500ms
 *          apply throttle down for 500ms
 *          If results are good
 *              save direction and try the next motor.
 *          If results are bad
 *              Abort!
