Ardupilot is the most advanced, full-featured and reliable open source autopilot software available. It has
been under development since 2010 by a team of diverse professional engineers and computer scientists. It is
the only autopilot software capable of controlling almost any vehicle system imaginable, from conventional
airplanes, multirotors, and helicopters, to boats and even submarines. And now being expanded to feature
support for new emerging vehicle types such as quad-planes and compound helicopters.
