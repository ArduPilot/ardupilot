# Vagrant for SITL and ardupilot development

We support a vagrant container for _easily_ running SITL (software in the loop simulator) and compling Ardupilot code.

Instructions for how to install and run this vagrant container are provided on the ArduPilot dev wiki in: [Setting up SITL using Vagrant](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/setting-up-sitl-using-vagrant/).
