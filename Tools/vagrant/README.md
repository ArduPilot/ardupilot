# Vagrant for SITL and ardupilot development

We support a vagrant container for _easily_ running SITL (software in the loop simulator) and compling Ardupilot code.

Instructions for how to install and run this vagrant container are provided on the ArduPilot dev wiki in: [Setting up SITL using Vagrant](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-using-vagrant.html).
