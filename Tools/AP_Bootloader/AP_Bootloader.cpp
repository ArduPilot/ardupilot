  ArduPilot bootloader. This implements the same protocol originally
  developed for PX4, but builds on top of the ChibiOS HAL

  It does not use the full AP_HAL API in order to keep the firmware
  size below the maximum of 16kByte required for F4 based
  boards. Instead it uses the ChibiOS APIs directly
