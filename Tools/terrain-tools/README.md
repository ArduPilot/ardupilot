# Terrain Tools

## Ground truthing terrain against rangefinder data

If you want to compare different terrain sources and compare the onboard terrain data against measured rangefinder data,
this section is for you.

A Jupyter notebook is attached. Open it up, start the kernel, install dependencies.
Then, modify the log file path to your BIN log.
When comparing to terrain data, download samples from Open Topography.
Try the [COP30](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.3) dataset or the [ALOS World 3D 30 meter DEM](https://portal.opentopography.org/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.112016.4326.2) by downloading a region that covers your log and modifying the script to load it.
