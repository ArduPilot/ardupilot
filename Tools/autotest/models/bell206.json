# Bell206 model

{
    # simulate a Bell 206 helicopter.  This model was taken from the following reference.
    # Zion, L, Tishler, M, Development of a Full Flight Envelope Helicopter Simulation using System Identification,
    # American Helicopter Societyâ€™s 63rd Annual Forum & Technology Display, Virginia Beach, VA, May 1-3, 2007.
    # The rotor control derivatives were modified as it was too sensitive with the ones in the paper assuming that 
    3 the controls inputs were percent (-100 to 100).
