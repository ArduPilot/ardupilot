Usage:
    python bin2hex.py [options] INFILE [OUTFILE]

Arguments:
    INFILE      name of bin file for processing.
                Use '-' for reading from stdin.

    OUTFILE     name of output file. If omitted then output
                will be writing to stdout.

Options:
    -h, --help              this help message.
    -v, --version           version info.
    --offset=N              offset for loading bin file (default: 0).
