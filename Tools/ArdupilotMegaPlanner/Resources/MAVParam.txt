== MAVLink Parameters == (this is a copy fo the wiki page FYI)

This is a list of all the user-modifiable MAVLink parameters and what they do. You can modify them via the MAVLink parameters window in any compatible GCS, such as the Mission Planner, HK GCS or !QGroundControl.

It includes both fixed wing (APM) and rotary wing (!ArduCopter) parameters. Some may only be relevant for one platform or another.

||XTRK_GAIN_SC||0||100||100||100||1||XTRACK_GAIN_SCALED - Default value is 1.0 degrees per metre.  Values lower than 0.001 will disable crosstrack compensation.||
||ALT_MIX||0||1||1||0.01||1||ALTITUDE_MIX - In Percent - Configures the blend between GPS and pressure altitude. 0 = GPS altitude, 1 = Press alt, 0.5 = half and half, etc.||
||ARSPD_RATIO||0||5||1.9936||1||1||AIRSPEED_RATIO - Adjust AIRSPEED_RATIO in small increments to calibrate the airspeed sensor relative to your GPS.  The calculation and default value are optimized for speeds around 12 m/s||
||WP_RADIUS||0||200||30||1||1||WP_RADIUS_DEFAULT - When the user performs a factory reset on the APM, sets the waypoint radius (the radius from a target waypoint within which the APM will consider itself to have arrived at the waypoint) to this value in meters.  This is mainly intended to allow users to start using the APM without programming a mission first.||
||WP_LOITER_RAD||0||200||60||1||1||LOITER_RADIUS_DEFAULT - When the user performs a factory reset on the APM, sets the loiter radius (the distance the APM will attempt to maintain from a waypoint while loitering) to this value in meters.  This is mainly intended to allow users to start using the APM without programming a mission first.||
||ARSPD_FBW_MIN||5||50||6||1||1||AIRSPEED_FBW_MIN - In m/s - Airspeed corresponding to minimum and maximum throttle in Fly By Wire B mode.||
||ARSPD_FBW_MAX||5||50||22||1||1||AIRSPEED_FBW_MAX - In m/s - Airspeed corresponding to minimum and maximum throttle in Fly By Wire B mode. AIRSPEED_FBW_MAX also sets the maximum airspeed that the cruise airspeed can be ""nudged"" to in AUTO mode when ENABLE_STICK_MIXING is set. In AUTO the cruise airspeed can be increased between AIRSPEED_CRUISE and AIRSPEED_FBW_MAX by positioning the throttle  stick in the top 1/2 of its range.  Throttle stick in the bottom 1/2 provide regular AUTO control.||
||THR_MIN||0||100||0||1||1||THROTTLE_MIN - The minimum throttle setting to which the autopilot will reduce the throttle while descending.  The default is zero, which is suitable for aircraft with a steady power-off glide.  Increase this value if your aircraft needs throttle to maintain a stable descent in level flight.||
||THR_MAX||0||100||75||1||1||THROTTLE_MAX - The maximum throttle setting the autopilot will apply.  The default is 75%. Reduce this value if your aicraft is overpowered or has complex flight characteristics at high throttle settings.||
||THR_FAILSAFE||0||0||1|| || ||THROTTLE_FAILSAFE - The throttle failsafe allows you to configure a software failsafe activated by a setting on the throttle input channel (channel 3).  This can be used to achieve a failsafe override on loss of radio control without having to sacrifice one of your FLIGHT_MODE settings as the  throttle failsafe overrides the switch-selected mode. Throttle failsafe is enabled by setting THROTTLE_FAILSAFE to 1.||
||THR_FS_ACTION||0||2||1||1|| ||THROTTLE_FAILSAFE_ACTION - The FAILSAFE_ACTION setting determines what APM will do when throttle failsafe  mode is entered while flying in AUTO mode.  This is important in order to avoid accidental failsafe behaviour when flying waypoints that take the aircraft temporarily out of radio range. If FAILSAFE_ACTION is 1 when failsafe is entered in AUTO or LOITER modes the aircraft will head for home in RTL mode.  If the throttle channel moves back up it will return to AUTO or LOITER mode. The default behavior is to ignore throttle failsafe in AUTO and LOITER modes.||
||TRIM_THROTTLE||0||90||45||1||1||THROTTLE_CRUISE - In Percent - The approximate throttle setting to achieve AIRSPEED_CRUISE in level flight. The default is 45% which is reasonable for a modestly powered aircraft.||
||TRIM_AUTO||0||1||1||1||1||AUTO_TRIM - !ArduPilot Mega can update its trim settings by looking at the radio inputs when switching out of MANUAL mode.  This allows you to manually trim your aircraft before switching to an assisted mode but it also means that you should avoid switching out of MANUAL while you have any control stick deflection.||
||FLTMODE_CH||5||8||8||1||1||FLIGHT_MODE_CHANNEL - Flight modes assigned to the control channel, and the input channel that is read for the control mode. Use a servo tester or the !ArduPilotMega_demo test program to check your switch settings. ATTENTION: Some !ArduPilot Mega boards have radio channels marked 0-7 and others have them marked the standard 1-8.  The FLIGHT_MODE_CHANNEL option uses channel numbers 1-8 (and defaults to 8). If you only have a three-position switch or just want three modes set your  switch to produce 1165, 1425, and 1815 microseconds and configure FLIGHT_MODE 1 & 2, 3 & 4 and 5 & 6 to be the same.  This is the default.  If you have FLIGHT_MODE_CHANNEL set to 8 (the default) and your control channel connected to input channel 8, the hardware failsafe mode will activate for any control input over 1750ms.||
||FLIGHT_MODE_1||0||14||11||1|| ||FLIGHT_MODE_1 - The following standard flight modes are available: MANUAL = Full manual control via the hardware multiplexer. STABILIZE = Tries to maintain level flight but can be overridden with radio control inputs. FLY_BY_WIRE_A = Autopilot style control via user input with manual throttle. FLY_BY_WIRE_B = Autopilot style control via user input, aispeed controlled with throttle. RTL = Returns to the Home location and then LOITERs at a safe altitude. AUTO = Autonomous flight based on programmed waypoints.||

||THR_FS_VALUE||850||1000||950||1||1||THROTTLE_FS_VALUE - If the throttle failsafe is enabled, THROTTLE_FS_VALUE sets the channel value below which the failsafe engages.  The default is 975ms, which is a very low throttle setting.  Most transmitters will let you trim the manual throttle position up so that you cannot engage the failsafe with a regular stick movement. Configure your receiver's failsafe setting for the throttle channel to the absolute minimum, and use the !ArduPilotMega_demo program to check that you cannot reach that value with the throttle control.
