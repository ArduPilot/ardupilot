# See https://pre-commit.com for more information, specially https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-run for manual trigger
# Some example useful invocations:
#  pre-commit run: this is what pre-commit runs by default when committing. This will run all hooks against currently staged files.
#  pre-commit run --all-files: run all the hooks against all the files. This is a useful invocation if you are using pre-commit in CI.
#  pre-commit run check-executables-have-shebangs: run the check-executables-have-shebangs hook against all staged files.

# Files or directory we want to excude from checking
