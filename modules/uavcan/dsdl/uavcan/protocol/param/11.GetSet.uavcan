#
# Get or set a parameter by name or by index.
# Note that access by index should only be used to retrieve the list of parameters; it is highly
# discouraged to use it for anything else, because persistent ordering is not guaranteed.
#

#
# Index of the parameter starting from 0; ignored if name is nonempty.
# Use index only to retrieve the list of parameters.
# Parameter ordering must be well defined (e.g. alphabetical, or any other stable ordering),
# in order for the index access to work.

uint13 index

#
# If set - parameter will be assigned this value, then the new value will be returned.
# If not set - current parameter value will be returned.
# Refer to the definition of Value for details.

Value value

# Name of the parameter; always preferred over index if nonempty.

# Actual parameter value.
#
# For set requests, it should contain the actual parameter value after the set request was
# executed. The objective is to let the client know if the value could not be updated, e.g.
# due to its range violation, etc.
#
# Empty value (and/or empty name) indicates that there is no such parameter.
