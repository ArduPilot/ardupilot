# This message is used for dynamic Node ID allocation.
#
# When a node needs to request a node ID dynamically, it will transmit an anonymous message transfer of this type.
# In order to reduce probability of CAN ID collisions when multiple nodes are publishing this request, the CAN ID
# field of anonymous message transfer includes a Discriminator, which is a special field that has to be filled with
# random data by the transmitting node. Since Discriminator collisions are likely to happen (probability approx.
# 0.006%), nodes that are requesting dynamic allocations need to be able to handle them correctly. Hence, a collision
# resolution protocol is defined (alike CSMA/CD). The collision resolution protocol is based on two randomized
# transmission intervals:
#
# - Request period - Trequest.
# - Follow up delay - Tfollowup.
#
# Recommended randomization ranges for these intervals are documented in the constants of this message type (see below).
# Random intervals must be chosen anew per transmission, whereas the Discriminator value is allowed to stay constant
# per node.
#
# In the below description the following terms are used:
# - Allocator - the node that serves allocation requests.
# - Allocatee - the node that requests an allocation from the Allocator.
#
# The response timeout is not explicitly defined for this protocol, as the Allocatee will request the allocation
# Trequest units of time later again, unless the allocation has been granted. Despite this, the implementation can
# consider the value of FOLLOWUP_TIMEOUT_MS as an allocation timeout, if necessary.
#
# On the allocatee's side the protocol is defined through the following set of rules:
#
# Rule A. On initialization:
# 1. The allocatee subscribes to this message.
# 2. The allocatee starts the Request Timer with a random interval of Trequest.
#
# Rule B. On expiration of Request Timer:
# 1. Request Timer restarts with a random interval of Trequest.
# 2. The allocatee broadcasts a first-stage Allocation request message, where the fields are assigned following values:
#    node_id                 - preferred node ID, or zero if the allocatee doesn't have any preference
#    first_part_of_unique_id - true
#    unique_id               - first MAX_LENGTH_OF_UNIQUE_ID_IN_REQUEST bytes of unique ID
#
# Rule C. On any Allocation message, even if other rules also match:
# 1. Request Timer restarts with a random interval of Trequest.
#
# Rule D. On an Allocation message WHERE (source node ID is non-anonymous) AND (allocatee's unique ID starts with the
# bytes available in the field unique_id) AND (unique_id is less than 16 bytes long):
# 1. The allocatee waits for Tfollowup units of time, while listening for other Allocation messages. If an Allocation
#    message is received during this time, the execution of this rule will be terminated. Also see rule C.
# 2. The allocatee broadcasts a second-stage Allocation request message, where the fields are assigned following values:
#    node_id                 - same value as in the first-stage
#    first_part_of_unique_id - false
#    unique_id               - at most MAX_LENGTH_OF_UNIQUE_ID_IN_REQUEST bytes of local unique ID with an offset
#                              equal to number of bytes in the received unique ID
#
# Rule E. On an Allocation message WHERE (source node ID is non-anonymous) AND (unique_id fully matches allocatee's
# unique ID) AND (node_id in the received message is not zero):
# 1. Request Timer stops.
# 2. The allocatee initializes its node_id with the received value.
# 3. The allocatee terminates subscription to Allocation messages.
# 4. Exit.

# These definitions have an advisory status; it is OK to pick higher values for both bounds, as it won't affect
# protocol compatibility. In fact, it is advised to pick higher values if the target application is not concerned
# about the time it will spend on completing the dynamic node ID allocation procedure, as it will reduce
# interference with other nodes, possibly of higher importance.
#

# must choose the highest unused node ID value for this allocation (except 126 and 127, that are reserved for
# network maintenance tools). E.g., if the allocation table is empty and the node has requested an allocation
# without any preference, the allocator will grant the node ID 125.
#
# If the preferred node ID is not zero, the allocator will traverse the allocation table starting from the
# preferred node ID upward, until a free node ID is found. If a free node ID could not be found, the
# allocator will restart the search from the preferred node ID downward, until a free node ID is found.
