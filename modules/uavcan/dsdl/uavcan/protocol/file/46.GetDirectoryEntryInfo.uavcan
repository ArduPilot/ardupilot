#
# This service can be used to retrieve a remote directory listing, one entry per request.
#
# The client should query each entry independently, iterating 'entry_index' from 0 until the last entry is passed,
# in which case the server will report that there is no such entry (via the fields 'entry_type' and 'error').
#
# The entry_index shall be applied to the ordered list of directory entries (e.g. alphabetically ordered). The exact
# sorting criteria does not matter as long as it provides the same ordering for subsequent service calls.
