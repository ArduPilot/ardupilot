# ECEF is an acronym for Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed, which is a cartesian
# coordinate system which rotates with the earth. The origin (0,0,0) is
# located at the center of the earth. The x-axis is a vector pointing from
# the origin with positive direction towards 0 degrees latitude and
# longitude (equator, at the prime meridian). The z-axis is a vector
# pointing from the origin towards the north-pole. The y-axis completes a
# right-handed coordinate system.
