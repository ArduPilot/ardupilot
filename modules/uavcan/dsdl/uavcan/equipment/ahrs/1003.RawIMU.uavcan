# The samples are represented in the body frame, the axes are ordered as follows:

#   3. angular velocity around Z (yaw rate)

# Linear acceleration samples in meter/(second^2).
# The samples are represented in the body frame, the axes are ordered as follows:

# Covariance matrix. The diagonal entries are ordered as follows:
