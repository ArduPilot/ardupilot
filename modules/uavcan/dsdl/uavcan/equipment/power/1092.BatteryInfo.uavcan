# Primary parameters.
# Some fields can be set to NAN if their values are unknown.
# Full charge capacity is expected to slowly reduce as the battery is aging. Normally its estimate is updated after
# every charging cycle.

# Status flags.
# Notes:
#  - CHARGING must be always set as long as the battery is connected to a charger, even if the charging is complete.

# Battery identification.
# Model instance ID must be unique within the same battery model name.
