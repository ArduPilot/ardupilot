/*

xml.h

Literal XML strings.

A literal XML string contains XML content. This declaration provides a simple
interface to the literal XML string handler. The XML string contains UTF8
content when the SOAP_C_UTFSTRING flag is set.

Note: the built-in _XML type provides the same functionality.

Example:
#import "xml.h"
struct ns__MyData
{ int num;
  XML str; // has XML content
};
struct ns__Mixed
{ int num;
  XML __any; // __any is not a tag: this allows parsing of mixed content
};
