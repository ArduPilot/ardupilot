------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 4.5.1 8th April 2024

This release fixes a critical bug in the CRSF R/C protocol parser that
can lead to a handfault and a vehicle crashing. A similar fix was
applied to the GHST protocol, although we believe that GHST could not
be affected by the bug, so this was just a precaution.

There are no other changes in this release.

AntennaTracker 1.0.0 28-Jul-2016
Changes from 0.8.0
1) Compensate for tracker tilt by converting earth-frame angle targets to body-frame servo outputs
2) Tracker location provided by EKF (still falls back to raw GPS if EKF is unable to provide position estimate)
3) PITCH_MIN, PITCH_MAX parameters replace PITCH_RANGE
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.8.0 22-Jun-2016
Changes from 0.7.8

4) Added MAV_UPDATE_RATE parameter to allow more easily setting the rate the vehicle sends position data
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7.8 10-Jun-2016
Changes from 0.7.7

2) VPOS dataflash logging message captures vehicle position
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7.7 31-May-2016

3) VBAR dataflash log message added to capture vehicle barometer data
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7.6 08-Feb-2016
Changes from 0.7.5
1) Fix logging of attitude and mode to dataflash 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 0.7.2
1) Request baro pressure from vehicle at 1hz
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7.2 1-Aug-2015
Changes from 0.7.1
1) Fixed Pitch
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7.1 29-May-2015
Changes from 0.7
1) Added support for continuous rotation (CR) servos
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.7 17-May-2015
Changes from 0.5 (skipped 0.6 to avoid confusion after the wrong version number was communicated on diydrones.com)
1) added support for 4th MAVLink channel
------------------------------------------------------------------
AntennaTracker 0.5 29-Apr-2015
Changes from 0.4
1) add SERVO_TEST mode which moves the servos to the position specified by a do-set-servo command (normally from MP's extended tuning page)
2) add DISTANCE_MIN parameter (default to 5m).  Vehicles must be at least this distance away for the tracker to track them.
3) add SYSID_TARGET parameter to specify which vehicle to follow which is useful if multiple vehicles are sharing the same network.  This param defaults to zero which means track the first vehicle.  Set to "0" to track the first vehicle found.
4) send request to vehicle for position updates at 1hz.  Improves reliability when used with copter which won't sent position data by default.
5) Listens for vehicle position updates on all channels
6) bug fix for LED on pixhawk so it flashes blue or green (instead of yellow) when waiting for he vehicle's position
------------------------------------------------------------------
