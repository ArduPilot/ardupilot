# AP Topographic Lift

This library is responsible for running model(s) that estimate the topographic lift. AP could support more advanced models, however only a simplistic model is supported today.

## Interface

* Current UAV location in global coordinates
* Ability to query terrain elevation at lat-lon coordinates
* Ability to retrieve the current wind estimate
