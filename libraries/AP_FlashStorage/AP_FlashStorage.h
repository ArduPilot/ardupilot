/*
  a class to allow for FLASH to be used as a memory backed storage
  backend for any HAL. The basic methodology is to use a log based
  storage system over two flash sectors. Key design elements:

  - erase of sectors only called on init, as erase will lock the flash
    and prevent code execution

  - write using log based system

  - read requires scan of all log elements. This is expected to be called rarely

  - assumes flash that erases to 0xFF and where writing can only clear
    bits, not set them

  - assumes flash sectors are much bigger than storage size. If they
    aren't then caller can aggregate multiple sectors. Designed for
    128k flash sectors with 16k storage size.

  - assumes two flash sectors are available
