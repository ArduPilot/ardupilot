/*
  AP_InternalError holds information about "should not happen" errors
  that have occured within ArduPilot.  This covers things like code
  paths that should not be crossed or pointers being null when they
  really, really shouldn't be.  It does NOT cover things like losing
  GPS lock at inopportune times - that's just bad luck, not bad
  programming.
