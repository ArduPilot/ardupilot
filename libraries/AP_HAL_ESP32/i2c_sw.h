 * @brief       Low-level I2C peripheral driver
 *
 * This interface provides a simple abstraction to use the MCUs I2C peripherals.
 * It provides support for 7-bit and 10-bit addressing and can be used for
 * different kind of register addressing schemes.
 *
 *
 * @section   sec_i2c_usage Usage
 *
 * Example for reading a 8-bit register on a device, using a 10-bit device
 * address and 8-bit register addresses and using a RESTART condition (CAUTION:
 * this example does not check any return values...):
 *
 * @code{c}
 * // initialize the bus (this is normally done during boot time)
 * i2c_init(dev);
 * ...
 * // before accessing the bus, we need to acquire it
 * i2c_acquire(dev);
 * // next we write the register address, but create no STOP condition when done
 * i2c_write_byte(dev, device_addr, reg_addr, (I2C_NOSTOP | I2C_ADDR10));
 * // and now we read the register value
 * i2c_read_byte(dev, device_addr, &reg_value, I2C_ADDR10);
 * // finally we have to release the bus
 * i2c_release(dev);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example for writing a 16-bit register with 16-bit register addressing and
 * 7-bit device addressing:
 *
 * @code{c}
 * // initialize the bus
 * i2c_init(dev);
 * ...
 * // first, acquire the shared bus again
 * i2c_acquire(dev);
 * // write the 16-bit register address to the device and prevent STOP condition
 * i2c_write_byte(dev, device_addr, reg_addr, I2C_NOSTOP);
 * // and write the data after a REPEATED START
 * i2c_write_bytes(dev, device_addr, reg_data, 2, 0);
 * // and finally free the bus again
 * i2c_release(dev);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section   sec_i2c_pull Pull Resistors
 *
 * The I2C signal lines SDA/SCL need external pull-up resistors which connect
 * the lines to the positive voltage supply Vcc. The I2C driver implementation
 * should enable the pin's internal pull-up resistors. There are however some
 * use cases for which the internal pull resistors are not strong enough and the
 * I2C bus will show faulty behavior. This can for example happen when
 * connecting a logic analyzer which will raise the capacitance of the bus. In
 * this case you should make sure you connect external pull-up resistors to both
 * I2C bus lines.
 *
 * The minimum and maximum resistances are computed by:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 * R_{min} &=& \frac{V_{DD} - V_{OL(max)}} {I_{OL}}\\
 * R_{max} &=& \frac{t_r} {(0.8473 \cdot C_b)}
 * \f}<br>
 * where:<br>
 * \f$ V_{DD} =\f$ Supply voltage,
 * \f$ V_{OL(max)} =\f$ Low level voltage,
 * \f$ I_{OL} =\f$ Low level output current,
 * \f$ t_r =\f$ Signal rise time,
 * \f$ C_b =\f$ Bus capacitance <br>
 * <br>The pull-up resistors depend on the bus speed.
 * Some typical values are:<br>
 * Normal mode:       10k&Omega;<br>
 * Fast mode:          2k&Omega;<br>
 * Fast plus mode:     2k&Omega;
 *
 * For more details refer to section 7.1 in:<br>
 * http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf
 *
 *
 * @section   sec_i2c_pm (Low-) power implications
 *
 * The I2C interface realizes a transaction-based access scheme to the bus. From
 * a power management perspective, we can leverage this by only powering on the
 * I2C peripheral while it is actually used, that is inside an i2c_acquire() -
 * i2c_release() block.
 *
 * After initialization, the I2C peripheral **should** be powered off (e.g.
 * through peripheral clock gating). It should only be powered on once a
 * transaction on the I2C bus starts, namely in the i2c_acquire() function. Once
 * the transaction is finished, the corresponding I2C peripheral **should** be
 * powered off again in the i2c_release() function.
 *
 * If the implementation puts the active thread to sleep while a transfer is in
 * progress (e.g. when using DMA), the implementation might need to block
 * certain power states.
