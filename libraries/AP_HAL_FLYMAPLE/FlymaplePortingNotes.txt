These notes describe the steps take to port ArduPilot to the Flymaple platform
http://www.open-drone.org/flymaple

Flymaple has an ARM based Cortex-3 STM32F103RE, 72MHz processor with 10DOF builtin sensors


Implementation

Unlike the Arduino versions of ArduPlane, the Flymaple port uses portions of
the libmaple library, including the stm32f1 core and some other libaries like
Wire, HardwareTimer, HArdwareSPI etc.

Most of the changes are confined to new directory libraries/AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE
which contains the Flymaple specific code. All the HAL modules have
been ported, sometimes based on HAL_AVR, sometimes HAL_PX4:
AnalogIn
AnalogSource
Console
GPIO
I2CDriver
RCInput
RCOoutput
Scheduler
Semaphores
SPIDriver
Storage
UARTDriver
Utility

The implementation of Storage uses EEPROM emulation code that uses 2 pages of
Flymaple FLASH ROM as EEPROM. It was copied from
AeroQuad_v3.2 to libraries/AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE/utility and slightly modified:
libraries/AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE/utility/EEPROM.*
libraries/AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE/utility/flash_stm32.*

Unlike other HAL ports, the namespace for Flymaple defined in
AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE_Namespace.h has a more extensive name: 'AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE_NS' else
get complaints from gcc 4.4.1 caused by collisions with other class names.

New board makefile mk/board/flymaple.mk, plus some other minor changes in
mk/*.mk

In other parts of the ArduPlane tree, the changes have been #ifdefed for
Flymaple except:

- ArduPlane/compat.pde
All the wiring compatibility functions have been inline-d, else get
contamination of the namespace at link time (multiple definitions of delay()
etc)

- libraries/AP_Compass/AP_Compass_HMC5843.cpp
- libraries/AP_Compass/Compass.h
- libraries/AP_Baro/AP_Baro_BMP085.cpp
Minor changes to raw data fetches to make them 32bit compatible. Should not
affect other platforms.

Some other minor edits to eliminate compiler warnings

Resource usage
Resources on the Flymaple board have been allocated by the HAL:

Pins
0	AP GPS on Flymaple Serial2  Rx in. This is where you connect the
        GPS. 3.3V only, NOT 5V tolerant
1       AP GPS on Flymaple Serial2  Tx out. This is where you connect the GPS.
	3.3V
6	Receiver PPM in
7	Console and Mavlink on Flymaple Serial1 Rx in. Also on connector
	"COM1". 5V tolerant.
8	Console and Mavlink on Flymaple Serial1 Tx out. Also on connector
	"COM1". 3.3V
15	3.3V board VCC analog in. Connect to 3.3V pin.
16	Airspeed analog in (if available). 3.3V, NOT 5V tolerant.
19	Battery current analog in (if available). 3.3V, NOT 5V tolerant.
20	Battery voltage analog in (on-board divider connected to board VIN)
29	Telemetry Tx to radio on Serial3 on connector labelled "GPS". 3.3V
30      Telemetry Rx from radio on Serial3 on connector labelled "GPS". 5V tolerant.

Timers
SysTick	1000Hz normal timers
1	RCInput
2	1000Hz Failsafe timer
3,4	RCOut
8	not used by AP

The SerialUSB (USB connection) to Flymaple is not used by AP. It can be used for
debugging inside AP_HAL_FLYMAPLE, using SerialUSB.println().

Installation on Linux

Tested with:
libmaple https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple http://leaflabs.com/docs/unix-toolchain.html
arm-none-eabi-g++ toolchain, version 4.4.1
on OpenSuSE 12.3
Mission Planner 1.2.78

You need a number of additional resources to build ArduPlane for Flymaple. I
have assumed that you will install them in your home directory, but they can really
go anywhere provided you make the appropriate changes

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple.git
cd libmaple
wget http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/codesourcery/gcc-arm-none-eabi-latest-linux32.tar.gz
tar xvzf gcc-arm-none-eabi-latest-linux32.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:~/libmaple/arm/bin
make

edit ArduPlane/config.mk to be something like:
#config.mk START
# Select maple_RET6 for Flymaple
BOARD = maple_RET6
# HAL_BOARD determines default HAL target.
HAL_BOARD ?= HAL_BOARD_FLYMAPLE
# The communication port used to communicate with the Flymaple
PORT = /dev/ttyACM0
# You must provide the path to the libmaple library directory:
LIBMAPLE_PATH = $(HOME)/libmaple
# Also, the ARM compiler tools MUST be in your current PATH like:
# export PATH=$PATH:~/libmaple/arm/bin
#config.mk END

Interrupt disabling on ARM

On AVR, ISRs run by default with the global interrupt enable flag disabled, 
whereas mainline code runs by default with global interrupt enable flag 
*enabled*. Which means that cli()/sei() in an ISR will have a different effect 
to cli()sei() in mainline code. Thats why code that *might* run in an ISR must 
use the special idiom: so that it restores the flag to the state it was before 
the critical block

On ARM, the global interrupt disable flag PRIMASK is not altered behind your 
back by hardware. By default its always clear (ie enabled) even in ISRs. A 
different mechanism prevents ISRs from being reinterrupted. This means that 
non-nested noInterrupts()/interrupts() will always leave the PRIMASK as it was 
(interrupts enabled) when the critical block started, whether in ISRs or 
mainline code.

Conclusion:

On AVR, cli()/sei() is dangerous both in ISRs *and* when nested.

On ARM, noInterrupts()/interrupts() is only dangerous when nested.

Sensor Orientation

The Flymaple board has no clear indication about which way is meant to be
'forward' or 'right', so we have adopted the following convention:

Aircraft 'Forward' is in the direction of the arrow marked 'Pitch' on the board, ie
towards pin 0.

Aircraft 'Right' is towards the bottom right corner of the board, towards pin 20 and
the 5V regulator

Aircraft 'Down' is away from the copper side of the board: 'right way up' is with
component side up.

Here in SE Queensland, in the southern hemisphere, the local mag field is 
substantially vertical (down? is that correct?), and so the following simple 
tests of the board should give the following results, using the mavproxy 
graphing tools, and with a board orientation parameter of none:

The aircraft coordinate system of ardupilot is:

X +ve forward
Y +ve right
Z +ve down

Compass
Orientation                               Results
Level, right way up                       Z -ve
Left side down                            Y +ve
Nose up                                   X +ve
(ie positive when that axis is pointing away from the earth, at least where I 
am)

Accelerometer
Orientation                               Results
Level, right way up                       Z -ve
Left side down                            Y +ve
Nose up                                   X +ve
(ie positive when that axis is pointing away from the earth, and consistent 
with compass in southern hemisphere)

Gyro
Rotation                                  Results
Yawing to right                           Z +ve
Rolling to right                          X +ve
Pitching up                               Y +ve

(ie right hand curl rule relative to the given axis)

Remaining issues:

1. For reasons I do not yet understand, the magnetic heading reported by
ArduPlance is 90 degrees away from what I think it should be.
The sensors on the Flymaple are all aligned with the nominal X, Y and Z axes
collinear. Pitch and roll axes point to the _corners_ of the board, not the
flat sides as might be considered normal for a sensor board.
Orientation is set to NONE, and yes, the reading of compass sensor registers
is in teh right order for the HMC5883.

2. Many alignment warnings emitted by the compiler from libraries/GCS_MAVLink
protocol.h eg:
mnt/disk2/src/ArduPlane-2.74b/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/include/mavlink/v1.0/ardupilotmega/../protocol.h: In function 'uint16_t _MAV_RETURN_uint16_t(const mavlink_message_t*, uint8_t)':
/mnt/disk2/src/ArduPlane-2.74b/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/include/mavlink/v1.0/ardupilotmega/../protocol.h:267: warning: cast from 'const char*' to 'const uint16_t*' increases required alignment of target type
