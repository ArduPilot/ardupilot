This example shows how to control both transmit and receive processes by software, based on HW events. 

Overflow and IO capture events of a single Capture & Compare timer is used to control timing of emulation of UART input sampling and
 output handling of the Rx and Tx signals. The associated input capture pin is dedicated to receive data. Any general-purpose output 
pin or associated output compare pin can be used for data transmission. The timer overflow period is set to the channel half bit rate 
by setting the timer auto reload register. 

illustrates the timing diagram.

Figure 3. UART duplex channel based on timer capture events

Transmission process control is based on regular interrupts from the timer overflow events. 
After data for transmission is stored into dedicated variable (transmit buffer simulated by SW), an internal transmission request appears and
 the nearest overflow interrupt is used to start a new transmission (maximum latency for transmission start could be half a bit period). 
This is because the same timer is used for control both transmit and receive processes not synchronized normally. Every even timer overflow
 event interrupt controls the consecutive edge changes of the transmitted signal on the dedicated output pin until the end of the frame 
transmission. Odd overflow interrupts are discarded.

The receive process uses both input capture and output compare feature of the same timer and its dedicated pin. 
Initially, the input capture is performed at the pin. After detecting the first falling edge, the value captured in the 
capture register is then used for compare purposes because the input pin functionality is switched to output compare mode (without 
affecting any output GPIO capability since the pin still stays in input mode). Due to the half-a-bit overflow period of the timer, the nearest
 output compare event points to the middle of the first receive bit (start bit). Sampling can be simulated by three consecutive reading of the 
input pin level at that moment and if, for each of them, a low level is detected, the correctly received start bit is evaluated. The receive 
process then continues by watching every next odd output compare event. The same three point sampling method can be performed with noise 
detection logic here and for all the other received data bits until the end of the current receive frame. All even compare interrupts are 
discarded. After the stop bits of the frame are sampled, the Rx pin is switched back to input capture mode and waits for the next frame 
start condition. The detection of noise while the stop bits are being sampled should cause a frame error. If a noise is detected during start 
bit, the receive process should be aborted and the Rx pin switched back to input capture mode while waiting for the next falling edge capture.

User can build an API interface upon this low level HW abstraction level. It can include the UART channel initialization, enable and disabl
e Rx and Tx channels, read and write the data flow (e.g. control the data buffers) and check the transactionsâ€™ status. Size of data, parity 
control number of stop bits or other control can be solved on pre-compilation level by conditional compilation to speed up the code when 
these features are not used.
