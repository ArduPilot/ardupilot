/// @file   AP_Test.h
/// @brief  A simple unit test framework.
///
/// AP_Test provides the usual test start, condition validation and reporting
/// functions in a compact form.
///
/// Each test must be contained within a block; either a standalone function or
/// a block within a function.  The TEST macro is used to start a test; it creates
/// the local object which will track the results of the test and saves the name
/// for later reporting.  Only one test may be performed within each block.
///
/// Within the test, use the REQUIRE macro to describe a condition that must be
/// met for the test to pass.  If the condition within the macro is not met,
/// the condition will be output as a diagnostic and the test will be considered
/// to have failed.
///
/// The test ends at the end of the block, and the result of the test will be
/// output as a diagnostic.
///
/// Optionally at the end of the test suite, the Test::report method may be used
/// to summarize the results of all of the tests that were performed.
///

/// Unit test state and methods.
///
class Test

    /// Constructor - creates a new test.
    ///
    /// Normally called by the TEST macro.

    /// Perform a success check.
    ///
    /// @param  expr    If false, the test has failed.
    /// @param  source  The expression source; emitted in the diagnostic
    ///                 indicating test failure.
