/**
 * Simulation model to simulate calibration of accelerometers and compasses.
 *
 * The vehicle rotation can be controlled by sending PWM values to the servos
 * input, denoted by PWM[i] for the i-th channel (starting by zero). All PWM
 * values must be in [1000, 2000], otherwise that will cause undefined
 * behavior.
 *
 * There are four control modes, that are set with PWM[4]:
 *
 *  1) Stop (1000 <= PWM[4] < 1100):
 *    Stop the vehicle, i.e., stop the actuation of the other modes.
 *
 *  2) Attitude (1100 <= PWM[4] < 1200):
 *    Rotate the vehicle to the specified attitude. The attitude is defined
 *    with the PWM channels 5, 6 and 7 for roll, pitch and yaw angles,
 *    respectively. The PWM value for a desired angle in radians is given by:
 *
 *        pwm(theta) = 1500 + 500 * round(theta / pi)
 *        where -pi <= theta <= pi
 *
 *  3) Simple autonomous compass calibration (1200 <= PWM[4] < 1300):
 *    Move continuously the vehicle through six calibration poses and do a
 *    rotation about each pose over a short period of time.
 *
 *  4) Angular Velocity (1300 <= PWM[4] <= 2000):
 *    Rotate the vehicle at a desired angular velocity. The angular velocity is
 *    specified by a rotation axis and an angular speed.
 *
 *    The x, y and z components of the rotation axis is given, respectively, by
 *    the PWM channels 5, 6 and 7 with an offset of 1500. The rotation axis is
 *    normalized internally, so that PWM[5,6,7] = [1600, 1300, 0] and
 *    PWM[5,6,7] = [1700, 1100, 0] means the same normalized rotation axis.
 *
 *    The angular speed value is specified by PWM[4]. The PWM value for a
 *    desired angular speed in radians/s is given by:
 *
 *        pwm(theta) = 1300 + 700 * round(theta / (2 * pi)),
 *        where 0 <= theta <= 2 * pi
