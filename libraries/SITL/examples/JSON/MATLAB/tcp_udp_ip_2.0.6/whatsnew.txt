History of tcp/udp/ip toolbox for MATLAB
========================================

Version 2.0.6  2008-03-06

  -Including precompiled pnet.mexw32 for support to in matlab R2007 (R2008?)
   No need to compile pnet.c to run at R2007....
   (Included a real application demo that uses UDP and simulates a UDP based DAQ system.)

Version 2.0.5  2003-09-16
  -Fixing all GNU License notes more proper and clear and writing an
   exception that make it "100%" legal and proper to use this as a plug-in
   as the basic intention of cause is. The note also makes it clear that
   you can link and distribute this toolbox as non-free stand alone as long as
   this part (the tcp_udp_ip toolbox) is distributed with it and fullfills
   the licence agreement for it. See license.txt

  - The windows dll is compiled with matlab 5.3 to make it possible to
   run in matlab 5.x

Version 2.0.4  2003-07-22
  -Major bug fix: 'readtofile' and 'writefromfile' now opens the files in
   binary mode also for the Windows platform which makes the toolbox work properly
   for many cases where it erlier failed. This probably solvs many bugs
   that could not be solved. erlier! 
  -changed call frequency of 'drawnow' from 1 per sec to 10 per seconds. 
  -'pnet_remote' now supports an array of conection handles for calls that
   do not return any thing.
  - new author adress information

Version 2.0.3  2002-04-23
  -Added support for the "single" (float 32-bit) datatype.

Version 2.0.2  2002-03-12
  Windows buggfixes (also bugs for unix):
  -Breaking blocking operations with ctrl-c now works (better..)
   Fixed with a call to drawnow evry second.
  -UDP receive of packets now works stable after initialzing fromlen
   in revfrom() call.

Version 2.0.1  2002-02-25
  -Long delays in windows is fixed by changing Sleep(...) in pnet.c
   to correspond to sleep(...) in unix by div. by 1000.
  -Added drawnow into SERVER loop in pnet_remote. 

Version 2.0 (Beta) 2002-02-14
   Complete rewrite of the API with new calls.
   All tcpip_* function is replaced with new mex function named pnet(....).
   NEW mutch faster support for datatypes and byte swapping!!
   Datatype support: double,char,uint8,unint16,uint32,int8,nint16,int32.
   Byte swapping support: native,swap,intel,network  byte orders.
   tcpip_feval family function replaced by the pnet_remote function.
   This version in not backwards compatible wit version 1.x but
     are similar -> easy to port (easy to write wrapper functions?)

Version 1.3        2001-01-13
   Added support to UDP/IP-packet transmission by Mike Medeiros
   This version is never published......

Verion 1.2.1       2001-01-04

   Bugfix of variable and file tranfer functions
   Prelimnaray remote execution interface!

Version 1.2        2000-12-14

   tcpip_servopen() replace by tcpip_servsocket() and
   tcpip_listen() Now its a non blocking multi connection
   server!!
   A simple webserver_demo is now also included.

Version 1.2 BETA   2000-11-20

   Bug fixed. multi connections work proper!


Version 1.1   1999-10-28

   Now also support for Windows 95/98(?)/NT4 By Mario Bergeron
   All data types is now supported to be sent/rec. in network byte
   order. Solaris and Linux also seams to work well without
   "broke pipe handling" bug!
   A demo that reads mail from a pop mail server is also included.


Version 1.0 Beta 1  1999-04-06

   Open connections as client or server and send/receive
   text strings. Works under Linux and Solaris.
   Under soloris some trouble with "broken pipe handling"
