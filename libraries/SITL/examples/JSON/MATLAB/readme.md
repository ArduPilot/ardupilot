This is a tool to allow MATLAB to interface with the SITL JSON backend.

The SITL_connector function can be used to simplify the connection process. SITL_connector.m uses the TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox 2.0.6 by Peter RydesÃ¤ter and is much (10x) faster than the MATLAB functions available with the instrument control toolbox (and free!). However this may require compilation of a mex file, prebuilt mex files are included in most cases they will work without the need to re-compile. 

see Copter/SIM_multicopter.m for example usage.

The function is defined as:
```
    SITL_connector(target_ip,state,init_function,physics_function,delta_t)
```
- target_ip: the IP address of the machine running SITL eg '127.0.0.1'

- state: this is the persistent physics state of the vehicle its is a structure and must contain the following felids:
```
    state.gyro(roll, pitch, yaw) (radians/sec) body frame
    state.attitude(roll, pitch yaw) (radians)
    state.accel(north, east, down) (m/s^2) body frame
    state.velocity(north, east,down) (m/s) earth frame
    state.position(north, east, down) (m) earth frame 
```
the structure can have also any other felids required for the physics model

- init_function: function handle that will be called to init the physics model, this will be called on the first run and after a SITL reboot. It should take and return the state.
    function state init(state)
    init_function = @(state)init(state);

- physics_function: function handle that will be called to update the physics model by a single time step. It should take in the state and array of 16 PWM inputs and return the state.
```
    function state = physics_step(pwm_in,state)
    physics_function = @(pwm_in,state)physics_step(pwm_in,state);
```
- delta_t: time step size the physics model wil use in seconds. Note that this is directly connected to the maximum speed you can run SITL at.

The JSON SITL interface is lock-step scheduled. This allows matlab breakpoints to work as normal.

Using the connection it should be possible to achieve > 1500 fps, at this speed MATLAB code efficiency plays a important factor in the max frame rate. For a 400hz physics time step this gives a maximum speedup of 4 to 5 times. For planes and rovers it should be possible to use a much larger physics time step resulting in a larger maximum speed up. Note that large speedups risk the GCS getting left behind.
