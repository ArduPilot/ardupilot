This is a example Helicopter Simulink model. This has accurate physics and can be run using the EKF. Blocks from this example could be used to make other vehicles without having to work out the conversions to the ArduPilot reference frames. Note that ground interaction is neglected, once you take off you can't land! heli_init.m must be run before the module will run.

Many thanks to [Bill Geyer](https://github.com/bnsgeyer) for providing this model.
