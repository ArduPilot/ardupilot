'''
This is an example builder script that sets up a rover in Morse to
be driven by ArduPilot.

The rover has the basic set of sensors that ArduPilot needs

To start the simulation use this:

  morse run rover.py

Then connect with ArduPilot like this:

  sim_vehicle.py --model morse --console --map

This model assumes you will setup a steering/throttle rover
