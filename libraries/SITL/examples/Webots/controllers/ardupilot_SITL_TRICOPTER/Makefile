### Generic Makefile.include for Webots controllers, physics plugins, robot
### window libraries, remote control libraries and other libraries
### to be used with GNU make
###
### Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux
### Languages: C, C++
###
### Authors: Olivier Michel, Yvan Bourquin, Fabien Rohrer

###-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
###
### This file is meant to be included from the Makefile files located in the
### Webots projects subdirectories. It is possible to set a number of variables
### to customize the build process, i.e., add source files, compilation flags,
### include paths, libraries, etc. These variables should be set in your local
### Makefile just before including this Makefile.include. This Makefile.include
### should never be modified.
###
### Here is a description of the variables you may set in your local Makefile:
###
### ---- C Sources ----
### if your program uses several C source files:
### C_SOURCES = my_plugin.c my_clever_algo.c my_graphics.c
###
### ---- C++ Sources ----
### if your program uses several C++ source files:
### CXX_SOURCES = my_plugin.cc my_clever_algo.cpp my_graphics.c++
###
### ---- Compilation options ----
### if special compilation flags are necessary:
### CFLAGS = -Wno-unused-result
###
### ---- Linked libraries ----
### if your program needs additional libraries:
### INCLUDE = -I"/my_library_path/include"
### LIBRARIES = -L"/path/to/my/library" -lmy_library -lmy_other_library
###
### ---- Linking options ----
### if special linking flags are needed:
### LFLAGS = -s
###
### ---- Webots included libraries ----
### if you want to use the Webots C API in your C++ controller program:
### USE_C_API = true
### if you want to link with the Qt framework embedded in Webots:
### QT = core gui widgets network
###
### ---- Debug mode ----
### if you want to display the gcc command line for compilation and link, as
### well as the rm command details used for cleaning:
### VERBOSE = 1
