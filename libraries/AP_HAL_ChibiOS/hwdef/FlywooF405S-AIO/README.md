## Pinout

## UART Mapping

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.
|Name|Pin|Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SERIAL0|COMPUTER|USB|
|SERIAL1|RX1/TX1|USART1 (ELRS, DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL2|TX2/RX2|USART2 (GPS, DMA on RX)|
|SERIAL3|TX3/RX3|USART3 (RC Input/Output, DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL4|TX4/RX4|UART4 (TELEM)|
|SERIAL5|TX5/RX5|UART5|
|SERIAL6|TX6/RX6|UART6 (VTX)|

USART1 and USART3 supports RX and TX DMA. UART4 supports TX DMA. USART2 supports RX DMA. UART5 and UART6 do not support DMA.

## RC Input
 
RC input is configured on UART1 or UART3, which supports serial RC protocols. This board does not support PPM.
  
## OSD Support

The GOKU F405 AIO supports OSD using OSD_TYPE 1 (MAX7456 driver).

## PWM Output

The GOKU F405 AIO supports up to 5 PWM outputs. The pads for motor output ESC1 to ESC4 on the above diagram are the first 4 outputs.All 5 outputs support DShot.

The PWM are in 3 groups:

PWM 1-2: Group 1
PWM 3-4: Group 2
LED: Group 3

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot. PWM 1-4 support bidirectional dshot.

## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builtin voltage sensor. The voltage sensor can handle 2S to 6S
LiPo batteries.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - BATT_MONITOR 4
 - BATT_VOLT_PIN 12
 - BATT_VOLT_MULT around 11
 - BATT_CURR_PIN 13
 - BATT_CURR_MULT around 60.2

These are set by default in the firmware and shouldn't need to be adjusted

## Compass

The GOKU F405 AIO does not have a builtin compass but it does have an external I2C connector.

## NeoPixel LED

The board includes a NeoPixel LED pad.

## Loading Firmware (you will need to compile your own firmware)

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the
*.apj firmware files.
