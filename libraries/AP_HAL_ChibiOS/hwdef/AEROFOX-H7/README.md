## Pinout

## UART Mapping

All UARTs, except UART1, are DMA enabled. UART corresponding to each SERIAL port, and its default protocol, are shown below:
- SERIAL0 -> USB (MAVLink2)
- SERIAL1 -> UART7 (ESC Telemetry)
- SERIAL2 -> UART4 (User configured)
- SERIAL3 -> UART5 (User configured)
- SERIAL4 -> USART2 (User configured)
- SERIAL5 -> USART1 (GPS)
- SERIAL6 -> UART8 (RCIN)
- SERIAL7 -> USART3 (MAVLink2)

## RC Input

SERIAL 6 is configured for RC input by default and is compatible with all ArduPilot supported protocols except PPM. For protocols requiring half-duplex serial to transmit telemetry (such as FPort) you should set SERAIL6_OPTIONS = 4 (Half-Duplex)

## PWM Output

The AEROFOXH7 support up to 16PWM outputs. All pins support DShot. Outputs 1-8 support bi-directional DShot.

The 16 PWM outputs are in 9 groups:

- PWM 1,2 in group1
- PWM 3,4  in group2
- PWM 5,6  in group3
- PWM 7,8 in group4
- PWM 9,10  in group5
- PWM 11  in group6
- PWM 12 in group7
- PWM 13,14 in group8
- PWM 15,16 in group9

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If any channel in a group uses DShot, then all channels in that group need to use DShot.

## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builting voltage and current sensor. The voltage sensor can handle up
to 12S LiPo batteries.

### The power A is onboard voltage sensor
It is enabled by default and has the following parameters set by default:s
- BATT_MONITOR 4
- BATT_VOLT_PIN 19
- BATT_CURR_PIN 9
- BATT_VOLT_MULT 21
- BATT_AMP_PERVL 40

### The power B is external PMU input
An additional power monitor input is provided and can be enabled by setting:
- BATT_MONITOR 4, then reboot and set the following:
- BATT_VOLT_PIN 10
- BATT_CURR_PIN 11
- BATT_VOLT_MULT 34
- BATT_AMP_PERVLT should be set as required by the specific monitor used

## Compass

A 5883L compass is installed inside the H7 flight control. When high current devices such as ESC and BEC are installed under the flight control board, the on-board compass is usually disabled and an external compass used mounted to minimize motor current effects.

## Loading Firmware
The board comes pre-installed with an ArduPilot compatible bootloader, allowing the
loading of *.apj firmware files with any ArduPilot compatible ground station. The
hardware also supports the PX4 Betaflight INAV firmware, which needs to be changed with STlink.
