# hw definition file for processing by chibios_hwdef.py
# for FMUv3 hardware (ie. for Pixhawk1, Pixhawk2 cube, XUAV2.1 etc)

# This hwdef.dat file contains a lot of comments so it can act as a
# reference for developers adding new boards.

# The hwdef.dat file defines all the hardware peripherals and pins for
# a port of ArduPilot to a board using the ChibiOS HAL. You should be
# able to write the hwdef.dat file for a new board with just the
# schematic for the board.

# This file is processed by chibios_hwdef.py to create hwdef.h for
# this board. You may find it useful to run chibios_hwdef.py manually
# when building this file for a new board. The resulting hwdef.h file
# is formatted to make it quite readable. It is strongly suggested
# that you read the resulting hwdef.h file when porting to a new board
# to make sure it has resulted in what you want.

# You should read this file in conjunction with the schematic for your
# board, the datasheet for the MCU for your board and the python
# tables file that we have extracted from the datasheet for your
# MCU. The python tables file is particularly important, so if you
# haven't seen it before go and look at it now. For the STM32F427 it
# it called STM32F427xx.py and it is in the hwdef/script/ directory
# inside the HAL_ChibiOS directory. That file tells you what each pin
# can do (the alternate functions table) and what DMA channels can be
# used for each peripheral type. The alternative functions table is
# particularly useful when doing a new hwdef.dat file as you can work
# out peripheral numbers given a port/pin name.

# We need to start off by saying what main CPU is on the board. There
# are two CPU identifiers that you need to specify. The first is the
# ChibiOS MCU type. So far we only support STM32F4xx for all STM32F4
# board types. In the future we will add F7 and other MCU types
# The second string needs to match the name of a config file in the
# libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/script directory. In this case we are
# using a F427 MCU, so we select STM32F427xx to match the
# STM32F427xx.py file in the script directory. If you are supporting a
# board type that doesn't have a python hardware database file yet
# then you will need to create one. There are scripts in the scripts
# directory to help with that by parsing the STM32 datasheets to
# extract the required DMA and alternate function tables.

# MCU class and specific type
MCU STM32F4xx STM32F427xx

# We set a specific HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE, allowing for custom config in
# drivers. For this to be used the subtype needs to be added to
# AP_HAL/AP_HAL_Boards.h as well.
define CONFIG_HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE_CHIBIOS_FMUV3

# Now we need to specify the APJ_BOARD_ID. This is the ID that the
# bootloader presents to GCS software so it knows if this firmware is
# suitable for the board. Please see
# https://github.com/ArduPilot/Bootloader/blob/master/hw_config.h for
# a list of current board IDs. If you add a new board type then please
# get it added to that repository so we don't get conflicts.

# Note that APJ is "ArduPilot JSON Firmware Format".

# board ID for firmware load
APJ_BOARD_ID 9

# Now you need to say what crystal frequency you have for this
# board. All of the clocks are scaled against this. Typical values are
# 24000000 or 8000000.

# crystal frequency
OSCILLATOR_HZ 24000000

# On some boards you will need to also set the various PLL values. See
# the defaults in common/mcuconf.h, and use the define mechanism
# explained later in this file to override values suitable for your
# board. Refer to your MCU datasheet or examples from supported boards
# in ChibiOS for the right values.

# Now define the voltage the MCU runs at. This is needed for ChibiOS
# to set various internal driver limits. It is in 0.01 volt units.


# This is the STM32 timer that ChibiOS will use for the low level
# driver. This must be a 32 bit timer. We currently only support
# timers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 21. See hal_st_lld.c in ChibiOS for details.

# ChibiOS system timer
STM32_ST_USE_TIMER 5

# Now the size of flash in kilobytes, for creating the ld.script.

# flash size
FLASH_SIZE_KB 2048

# Now define which UART is used for printf(). We rarely use printf()
# in ChibiOS, so this is really only for debugging very early startup
# in drivers.

# Serial port for stdout. This is optional. If you leave it out then
# output from printf() lines will go to the ArduPilot console, which is the
# first UART in the SERIAL_ORDER list.  But note that some startup code
# runs before USB is set up. 
# The value for STDOUT_SERIAL is a serial device name, and must be for a 
# serial device for which pins are defined in this file. For example, SD7
# is for UART7 (SD7 == "serial device 7" in ChibiOS).
#STDOUT_SERIAL SD7
#STDOUT_BAUDRATE 57600

# Now the USB setup, if you have USB. All of these settings are
# option, and the ones below are the defaults. It ends up creating a
# USB ID on Linux like this:
# /dev/serial/by-id/usb-ArduPilot_fmuv3_3E0031000B51353233343932-if00
# If creating a board for a RTF vehicle you may wish to customise these.

# USB setup
USB_STRING_MANUFACTURER "ArduPilot"

# Now define the order that I2C buses are presented in the hal.i2c API
# in ArduPilot. For historical reasons inherited from HAL_PX4 the
# 'external' I2C bus should be bus 1 in hal.i2c, and internal I2C bus
# should be bus 0. On fmuv3 the STM32 I2C1 is our external bus and
# I2C2 is our internal bus, so we need to setup the order as I2C2
# followed by I2C1 in order to achieve the conventional order that
# drivers expect.

# order of I2C buses
I2C_ORDER I2C2 I2C1

# Now the serial ordering. These map to the SERIALn_ parameter numbers
# If you use a shorter list then HAL_Empty::UARTDriver
# objects are substituted for later UARTs, or you can leave a gap by
# listing one or more of the uarts as EMPTY.

# The normal usage of this ordering is:
# 1) SERIAL0: console (primary mavlink, usually USB)
# 2) SERIAL1: telem1
# 3) SERIAL2: telem2
# 4) SERIAL3: primary GPS
# 5) SERIAL4: GPS2
# 6) SERIAL5: extra UART (usually RTOS debug console)

# order of UARTs (and USB)
SERIAL_ORDER OTG1 USART2 USART3 UART4 UART8 UART7

# If the board has an IOMCU connected via a UART then this defines the
# UART to talk to that MCU. Leave it out for boards with no IOMCU.

# UART for IOMCU
IOMCU_UART USART6

# Now we start on the pin definitions. Every pin used by ArduPilot
# needs to be in this file. The pins in this file can be defined in any order.

# The format is P+port+pin. So PC4 is portC pin4.
# For every pin the second column is the label. If this is a
# peripheral that has an alternate function defined in the STM32
# datasheet then the label must be the name of that alternative
# function. The names are looked up in the python database for this
# MCU. Please see STM32F427xx.py for the F427 database. That database
# is used to automatically fill in the alternative function (and later
# for the DMA channels).

# The third column is the peripheral type. This must be one of the
# following: UARTn, USARTn, OTGn, SPIn, I2Cn, ADCn, TIMn, SWD, SDIO,
# INPUT, OUTPUT, CS.

# The fourth and later columns are for modifiers on the pin. The
# possible modifiers are:
# pin speed: SPEED_VERYLOW, SPEED_LOW, SPEED_MEDIUM, SPEED_HIGH
# pullup: PULLUP, PULLDOWN, FLOATING
# out type: OPENDRAIN, PUSHPULL
# default value: LOW, HIGH

# Additionally, each class of pin peripheral can have extra modifiers
# suitable for that pin type. For example, for an OUTPUT you can map
# it to a GPIO number in hal.gpio using the GPIO(n) modifier. For ADC
# inputs you can apply a scaling factor (to bring it to unit volts)
# using the SCALE(x) modifier. See the examples below for more
# modifiers, or read the python code in chibios_hwdef.py.

# Now we define UART4 which is for the GPS. Be careful
# of the difference between USART and UART. Check the STM32F427xx.py
# if unsure which it is. For a UART we need to specify at least TX and
# RX pins.

# UART4 serial GPS
PA0 UART4_TX UART4
PA1 UART4_RX UART4

# Now define the primary battery connectors. The labels we choose here
# are used to create defines for pins in the various drivers, so
# choose names that match existing board setups where possible. Here
# we define two pins PA2 and PA3 for voltage and current sensing, with
# a scale factor of 1.0 and connected on ADC1. The pin number this
# maps to in hal.adc is automatically determined using the datasheet
# tables in STM32F427xx.py.

# Now the VDD sense pin. This is used to sense primary board voltage.

the defaults for the peripheral class are used.

# setup as OPENDRAIN.

PC3 AUX_POWER ADC1 SCALE(1)

PE10 VDD_5V_HIPOWER_nOC INPUT PULLUP
PE15 VDD_5V_PERIPH_nOC INPUT PULLUP

# Now the SPI device table. This table creates all accessible SPI
# devices, giving the name of the device (which is used by device
# drivers to open the device), plus which SPI bus it it on, what
# device ID will be used (which controls the IDs used in parameters
# such as COMPASS_DEV_ID, so we can detect when the list of devices
# changes between reboots for calibration purposes), the SPI mode to
# use, and the low and high speed settings for the device.

# You can define more SPI devices than you actually have, to allow for
# flexibility in board setup, and the driver code can probe to see
# which are responding.

# The DEVID values and device names are chosen to match the PX4 port
# of ArduPilot so users don't need to re-do their accel and compass
# calibrations when moving to ChibiOS.
