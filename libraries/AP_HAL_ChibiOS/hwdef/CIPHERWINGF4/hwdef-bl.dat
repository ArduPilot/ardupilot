# Ensure active SPI peripherals are deasserted (CS high) in bootloader
PA4  MPU6000_CS CS     # IMU CS (also used by ICM20689/BMI270 via same CS)
PA15 OSD_CS     CS     # MAX7456 OSD CS
PB3  BMP280_CS  CS     # BMP280 baro CS

# NOTE:
# - SD card was removed from the main hwdef.dat, so PB12 SDCARD_CS is omitted here.
# - No bootloader changes are needed for I2C1 on PB8/PB9 or for PWM/UART remaps.
#   The application firmware will configure those after boot.
