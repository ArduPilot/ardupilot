# KakuteF4 AIO Flight Controller

The [KakuteF4 AIO](http://www.holybro.com/product/47) is a flight controller produced by [Holybro](http://www.holybro.com).

## Features

 - STM32F405 microcontroller
 - ICM20689 IMU
 - BMP280 barometer
 - MAX7456 OSD
 - 5 UARTs
 - 4 PWM outputs

## Pinout

## UART Mapping

 - SERIAL0 -> USB
 - SERIAL1 -> UART6 (Telem1)
 - SERIAL2 -> UART1 (FrSky S.Port)
 - SERIAL3 -> UART4 (GPS)
 - SERIAL4 -> UART5 (ESC Telemetry, RX only)
 - SERIAL5 -> UART3 (spare, TX only)

## RC Input
 
RC input is configured on the R6 (UART3_RX) pin. It supports all RC protocols.
 
## FrSky Telemetry
 
FrSky Telemetry is supported using the SmartPort pad (UART1). You need
to set the following parameters to enable support for FrSky S.PORT. It
has builtin inverters and a diode to allow for operation from a single
pin with no special adapters.
 
  - SERIAL2_PROTOCOL 10
  - SERIAL2_OPTIONS 0
  
## OSD Support

The KakuteF4 supports OSD using OSD_TYPE 1 (MAX7456 driver).

## PWM Output

The KakuteF4 supports up to 4 PWM outputs. The pads for motor output
M1 to M4 on the above diagram are for the 4 outputs. All 4 outputs
support DShot as well as all PWM types. The M5 and M6 outputs are not
currently available with ArduPilot.

The PWM is in 2 groups:

 - PWM 1 and 4 in group1
 - PWM 2 and 3 in group2

Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot.

## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builting voltage and current sensor. The voltage
sensor can handle up to 6S LiPo batteries.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - BATT_MONITOR 4
 - BATT_VOLT_PIN 13
 - BATT_CURR_PIN 12
 - BATT_VOLT_MULT 10.1
 - BATT_AMP_PERVLT 17.0

## Compass

The KakuteF4 AIO does not have a builting compass, but you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.

## Logging

The KakuteF4 does not support on-board logging at this time.

## Loading Firmware

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the
*.apj firmware files.
