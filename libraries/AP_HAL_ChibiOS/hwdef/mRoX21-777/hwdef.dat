# The X2.1-777 is a member of the X2.1 flight controller from Mayan Robotics (mRo)
# Introduced in October 2018
# Designed by Nick Arsov, Phillip Kocmoud, and Jordi Munoz
# with a STM32F777VIT6 MCU
# and STM32F103C8T6 IO MCU

# MCU class and specific type
MCU STM32F7xx STM32F777xx

# we set a specific HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE, allowing for custom config in
# drivers. For this to be used the subtype needs to be added to
# AP_HAL/AP_HAL_Boards.h as well
define CONFIG_HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE_CHIBIOS_FMUV3

# Set Proper Sensor Orientation
define BOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT 20

# now we need to specify the APJ_BOARD_ID. This is the ID that the
# bootloader presents to GCS software so it knows if this firmware is
# suitable for the board. Please see
# https://github.com/ArduPilot/Bootloader/blob/master/hw_config.h for
# a list of current board IDs. If you add a new board type then please
# get it added to that repository so we don't get conflicts.

# Note that APJ is "ArduPilot JSON Firmware Format"

# crystal frequency
OSCILLATOR_HZ 24000000

# board ID for firmware load
APJ_BOARD_ID 136

# on some boards you will need to also set the various PLL values. See
# the defaults in common/mcuconf.h, and use the define mechanism
# explained later in this file to override values suitable for your
# board. Refer to your MCU datasheet or examples from supported boards
# in ChibiOS for the right values.

# now define the voltage the MCU runs at. This is needed for ChibiOS
# to set various internal driver limits. It is in 0.01 volt units


# this is the STM32 timer that ChibiOS will use for the low level
# driver. This must be a 32 bit timer. We currently only support
# timers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 21. See hal_st_lld.c in ChibiOS for details

# ChibiOS system timer
STM32_ST_USE_TIMER 5

# now the size of flash in kilobytes, for creating the ld.script

# flash size
FLASH_SIZE_KB 2048

env OPTIMIZE -O2

# now define which UART is used for printf(). We rarely use printf()
# in ChibiOS, so this is really only for debugging very early startup
# in drivers.

# serial port for stdout. This is optional. If you leave it out then
# output from printf() lines will be sent to
# hal.console->printf() for the ArduPilot console, which is the first
# UART in the SERIAL_ORDER list. The value for STDOUT_SERIAL is a
# serial device name, and must be for a serial device for which pins
# are defined in this file. For example, SD7 is for UART7 (SD7 ==
# "serial device 7" in ChibiOS).
STDOUT_SERIAL SD7
STDOUT_BAUDRATE 57600

# now the USB setup, if you have USB. All of these settings are
# option, and the ones below are the defaults. It ends up creating a
# USB ID on Linux like this:
# /dev/serial/by-id/usb-ArduPilot_fmuv3_3E0031000B51353233343932-if00
# if creating a board for a RTF vehicle you may wish to customise these

# USB setup
USB_STRING_MANUFACTURER "mRo"

# this board only has a single I2C bus so make it external
define HAL_I2C_INTERNAL_MASK 0

# order of I2C buses
I2C_ORDER I2C1

# now the UART order. These map to the hal.uartA to hal.uartF
# objects. If you use a shorter list then HAL_Empty::UARTDriver
# objects are substituted for later UARTs, or you can leave a gap by
# listing one or more of the uarts as EMPTY

# the normal usage of this ordering is:
# 1) SERIAL0: console (primary mavlink, usually USB)
# 2) SERIAL3: primary GPS
# 3) SERIAL1: telem1
# 4) SERIAL2: telem2
# 5) SERIAL4: GPS2
# 6) SERIAL5: extra UART (usually RTOS debug console)

# order of UARTs (and USB)
SERIAL_ORDER OTG1 USART2 USART3 UART4 UART8 UART7 OTG2

# if the board has an IOMCU connected via a UART then this defines the
# UART to talk to that MCU. Leave it out for boards with no IOMCU

# UART for IOMCU
IOMCU_UART USART6

# now we start on the pin definitions. Every pin used by ArduPilot
# needs to be in this file. The format is P+port+pin. So PC4 is portC
# pin4. For every pin the 2nd colum is the label. If this is a
# peripheral that has an alternate function defined in the STM32
# datasheet then the label must be the name of that alternative
# function. The names are looked up in the python database for this
# MCU. Please see STM32F427xx.py for the F427 database. That database
# is used to automatically fill in the alternative function (and later
# for the DMA channels).

# The third column is the peripheral type. This must be one of the
# following: UARTn, USARTn, OTGn, SPIn, I2Cn, ADCn, TIMn, SWD, SDIO,
# INPUT, OUTPUT, CS

# the fourth and later columns are for modifiers on the pin. The
# possible modifiers are
# pin speed: SPEED_VERYLOW, SPEED_LOW, SPEED_MEDIUM, SPEED_HIGH
# pullup: PULLUP, PULLDOWN, FLOATING
# out type: OPENDRAIN, PUSHPULL
# default value: LOW, HIGH

# Additionally, each class of pin peripheral can have extra modifiers
#  suitable for that pin type. For example, for an OUTPUT you can map
#  it to a GPIO number in hal.gpio using the GPIO(n) modifier. For ADC
#  inputs you can apply a scaling factor (to bring it to unit volts)
#  using the SCALE(x) modifier. See the examples below for more
#  modifiers, or read the python code in chibios_hwdef.py

# now we define UART4 which is for the GPS, which is a GPS. Be careful
# of the difference between USART and UART. Check the STM32F427xx.py
# if unsure which it is. For a UART we need to specify at least TX and
# RX pins.

# this pins in this file can be defined in any order.

# UART4 serial GPS
PA0 UART4_TX UART4
PA1 UART4_RX UART4

# now define the primary battery connectors. The labels we choose hear
# are used to create defines for pins in the various drivers, so
# choose names that match existing board setups where possible. Here
# we define two pins PA2 and PA3 for voltage and current sensing, with
# a scale factor of 1.0 and connected on ADC1. The pin number this
# maps to in hal.adc is automatically determined using the datasheet
# tables in STM32F427xx.py

# now the VDD sense pin. This is used to sense primary board voltags

# now the first SPI bus. At minimum you need SCK, MISO and MOSI pin
definitions. You can add speed modifiers if you want them, otherwise
the defaults for the peripheral class are used.

# now the SPI device table. This table creates all accessible SPI
# devices, giving the name of the device (which is used by device
# drivers to open the device), plus which SPI bus it it on, what
# device ID will be used (which controls the IDs used in parameters
# such as COMPASS_DEV_ID, so we can detect when the list of devices
# changes between reboots for calibration purposes), the SPI mode to
# use, and the low and high speed settings for the device

# You can define more SPI devices than you actually have, to allow for
# flexibility in board setup, and the driver code can probe to see
# which are responding

# The DEVID values and device names are chosen to match the PX4 port
# of ArduPilot so users don't need to re-do their accel and compass
# calibrations when moving to ChibiOS
