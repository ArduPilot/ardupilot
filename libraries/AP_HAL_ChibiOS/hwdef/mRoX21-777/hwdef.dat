# The X2.1-777 is a member of the X2.1 flight controller from Mayan Robotics (mRo)
# Introduced in October 2018
# Designed by Nick Arsov, Phillip Kocmoud, and Jordi Munoz
# with a STM32F777VIT6 MCU
# and STM32F103C8T6 IO MCU

# MCU class and specific type
MCU STM32F7xx STM32F777xx

# we set a specific HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE, allowing for custom config in
# drivers. For this to be used the subtype needs to be added to
# AP_HAL/AP_HAL_Boards.h as well
define CONFIG_HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE HAL_BOARD_SUBTYPE_CHIBIOS_FMUV3

# Set Proper Sensor Orientation
define BOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT 20

# now we need to specify the APJ_BOARD_ID. This is the ID that the
# bootloader presents to GCS software so it knows if this firmware is
# suitable for the board. Please see
# https://github.com/ArduPilot/Bootloader/blob/master/hw_config.h for
# a list of current board IDs. If you add a new board type then please
# get it added to that repository so we don't get conflicts.

# Note that APJ is "ArduPilot JSON Firmware Format"

# on some boards you will need to also set the various PLL values. See
# the defaults in common/mcuconf.h, and use the define mechanism
# explained later in this file to override values suitable for your
# board. Refer to your MCU datasheet or examples from supported boards
# in ChibiOS for the right values.

# now define the voltage the MCU runs at. This is needed for ChibiOS
# to set various internal driver limits. It is in 0.01 volt units

# board voltage
STM32_VDD 330U

# this is the STM32 timer that ChibiOS will use for the low level
# driver. This must be a 32 bit timer. We currently only support
# timers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 21. See hal_st_lld.c in ChibiOS for details

# now define which UART is used for printf(). We rarely use printf()
# in ChibiOS, so this is really only for debugging very early startup
# in drivers.

# serial port for stdout. This is optional. If you leave it out then
# output from printf() lines will be thrown away (you can stil use
# hal.console->printf() for the ArduPilot console, which is the first
# UART in the UART_ORDER list). The value for STDOUT_SERIAL is a
# serial device name, and must be for a serial device for which pins
# are defined in this file. For example, SD7 is for UART7 (SD7 ==
# "serial device 7" in ChibiOS).
STDOUT_SERIAL SD7
STDOUT_BAUDRATE 57600

# now the USB setup, if you have USB. All of these settings are
# option, and the ones below are the defaults. It ends up creating a
# USB ID on Linux like this:

# this board only has a single I2C bus so make it external
define HAL_I2C_INTERNAL_MASK 0

# order of I2C buses
I2C_ORDER I2C1

# now the UART order. These map to the hal.uartA to hal.uartF
# objects. If you use a shorter list then HAL_Empty::UARTDriver
# objects are substituted for later UARTs, or you can leave a gap by
# listing one or more of the uarts as EMPTY

# the normal usage of this ordering is:
# 1) SERIAL0: console (primary mavlink, usually USB)
# 2) SERIAL3: primary GPS
# 3) SERIAL1: telem1
# 4) SERIAL2: telem2
# 5) SERIAL4: GPS2
# 6) SERIAL5: extra UART (usually RTOS debug console)

# order of UARTs (and USB)

# default the 2nd interface to MAVLink2 until MissionPlanner updates drivers
define HAL_OTG2_PROTOCOL SerialProtocol_MAVLink2

# if the board has an IOMCU connected via a UART then this defines the
# UART to talk to that MCU. Leave it out for boards with no IOMCU

# UART for IOMCU
IOMCU_UART USART6

# now we start on the pin definitions. Every pin used by ArduPilot
# needs to be in this file. The format is P+port+pin. So PC4 is portC
# pin4. For every pin the 2nd colum is the label. If this is a
# peripheral that has an alternate function defined in the STM32
# datasheet then the label must be the name of that alternative
# function. The names are looked up in the python database for this
# MCU. Please see STM32F427xx.py for the F427 database. That database
# is used to automatically fill in the alternative function (and later
# for the DMA channels).

# The third column is the peripheral type. This must be one of the
# following: UARTn, USARTn, OTGn, SPIn, I2Cn, ADCn, TIMn, SWD, SDIO,
# INPUT, OUTPUT, CS

# the fourth and later columns are for modifiers on the pin. The
# possible modifiers are
# pin speed: SPEED_VERYLOW, SPEED_LOW, SPEED_MEDIUM, SPEED_HIGH
# pullup: PULLUP, PULLDOWN, FLOATING
# out type: OPENDRAIN, PUSHPULL
# default value: LOW, HIGH

# Additionally, each class of pin peripheral can have extra modifiers
#  suitable for that pin type. For example, for an OUTPUT you can map
#  it to a GPIO number in hal.gpio using the GPIO(n) modifier. For ADC
#  inputs you can apply a scaling factor (to bring it to unit volts)
#  using the SCALE(x) modifier. See the examples below for more
#  modifiers, or read the python code in chibios_hwdef.py

# now we define UART4 which is for the GPS, which is a GPS. Be careful
# of the difference between USART and UART. Check the STM32F427xx.py
# if unsure which it is. For a UART we need to specify at least TX and
# RX pins.

# this pins in this file can be defined in any order.

# UART4 serial GPS
PA0 UART4_TX UART4
PA1 UART4_RX UART4

# now define the primary battery connectors. The labels we choose hear
# are used to create defines for pins in the various drivers, so
# choose names that match existing board setups where possible. Here
# we define two pins PA2 and PA3 for voltage and current sensing, with
# a scale factor of 1.0 and connected on ADC1. The pin number this
# maps to in hal.adc is automatically determined using the datasheet
# tables in STM32F427xx.py

# now the SPI device table. This table creates all accessible SPI
# devices, giving the name of the device (which is used by device
# drivers to open the device), plus which SPI bus it it on, what
# device ID will be used (which controls the IDs used in parameters
# such as COMPASS_DEV_ID, so we can detect when the list of devices
# changes between reboots for calibration purposes), the SPI mode to
# use, and the low and high speed settings for the device

# You can define more SPI devices than you actually have, to allow for
# flexibility in board setup, and the driver code can probe to see
# which are responding

# The DEVID values and device names are chosen to match the PX4 port
# of ArduPilot so users don't need to re-do their accel and compass
# calibrations when moving to ChibiOS
