# this is based on the CubeBlack hwdef, with Solo's required parameter defaults
# The CUBE green is identical to a CUBE Black, but uses 5v signalling for the Solo ESC issues
# do not use this hwdef with any configuration other than a 3DR Solo with a Green Cube running Copter 3.7.

# pull Solo's default parameters from /Tools/Frame_params
# these are parameters the Solo requires for proper operation that are differnet from the 3.7 standard defaults.
