# hw definition file for processing by chibios_hwdef.py
# for The CUBE Green hardware in a 3DR Solo
# this is based on the CubeBlack hwdef, with Solo's required parameter defaults
# The CUBE green is identical to a CUBE Black, but uses 5v signalling for the Solo ESC issues
# do not use this hwdef with any configuration other than a 3DR Solo with a Green Cube running Copter 4.
