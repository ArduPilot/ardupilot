## UART Mapping

The UARTs are marked Rx and Tx in the above pinouts.

========== ========== ======== ====================
 Name      Pad        Port       Default Protocol  
========== ========== =======  ==================== 
 SERIAL 0  DM/DP      USB       Mavlink            
 SERIAL 1  RX1/TX1    USART 1   RCin (DMA) 
 SERIAL 2  RX3/TX3    USART 3   ESC   
 SERIAL 3  RX6/TX6    USART 6   GPS1 (DMA)       
 SERIAL 4  RX4/TX4    USART 4   GPS2    
========== ========== =======  ==================== 

* USART1 and USART6 supports RX and TX DMA.  
* UART2 and UART4 do not support DMA.  
* ESC Telemetry need to be manually configured based upon esc.


## RC Input

 RC input is configured by default on the R1 and T1 (UART1) pads (CRSF or ELRS).  
 SBUS pad is inverted and applied to R1  
 
* FPort requires connection to T1 and :ref:`SERIAL1_OPTIONS<SERIAL1_OPTIONS>` be set to “7”.
* CRSF also requires a T1 connection, in addition to R1, and automatically provides telemetry. Set :ref:`SERIAL1_OPTIONS<SERIAL1_OPTIONS>` to “0”.
* SRXL2 requires a connecton to T1 and automatically provides telemetry. Set :ref:`SERIAL1_OPTIONS<SERIAL1_OPTIONS>` to “4”.

Any UART can be used for RC system connections in ArduPilot also, and is compatible with all protocols except PPM. See Radio Control Systems for details.


## OSD
- ANALOG OSD (MAX7456) (SPI1) (Preconfigured)  
- DIGITAL OSD (MSP)    (UART4 can be used for MSP Displayport by changing :ref:`SERIAL4_PROTOCOL<SERIAL4_PROTOCOL>` to "42")  


## PWM Output
The autopilot supports up to 9 PWM outputs (PWM 9 is defaulted to serial LED support). Outputs are available a standard ESC JST-SH connectors and solder pads for M5-M8. All outputs support  DShot,as well as all PWM types. 

The PWM is in 5 groups:

- PWM 1,2 in group1
- PWM 3,4 in group2 
- PWM 5   in group3
- PWM 6,7 in group4
- PWM 8,9 in group5

 Pads for PWM 1-8 are available on bottom side of pcb  
 ESC port is a jst-sh V-G-C-R3-1-2-3-4  

 Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. All channels in specific Timer groups are configured either as DSHOT or PWM,  
 mixing of protocols within groups is not possible. Channel 9 is configured as NeoPixel by default but can be configured for and extra PWM output.  


## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builtin voltage sensor, voltage sensor supports up to 6S LiPo.  
The default battery configuration is:  

- BATT_MONITOR 4
- BATT_VOLT_PIN 14
- BATT_VOLT_MULT 11
- BATT_CURR_PIN 13
- BATT_CURR_MULT 37


## Compass & Baro

 The autopilot does not have a built-in compass, however you can attach an external compass using I2C on the SDA and SCL pads.


## Firmware¶

Firmware for this board can be found `here <https://firmware.ardupilot.org`__  in sub-folders labeled “BrahmaF4”.
Loading Firmware¶

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the “with_bl.hex” firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using any ArduPilot ground station software. Later updates should be done with the \*.apj firmware files.
