## Pinout

The expansion connector provides access to the following pins:
 - CAN+/CAN-
 - M9 through M12
 - TX7/RX7
 - SCL2/SDA2
 - RSSI
 - 5V/12V/GND

## UART Mapping

The UARTs are marked Rn and Tn in the above pinouts. The Rn pin is the
receive pin for UARTn. The Tn pin is the transmit pin for UARTn.
|Name|Pin|Function|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SERIAL0|COMPUTER|USB|
|SERIAL1|RX1/TX1|UART1 (DJI connector, DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL2|TX2/RX2|UART2 (RX, DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL3|TX3/RX3|UART3 (DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL4|TX4/RX4|UART4 (GPS, DMA-enabled)|
|SERIAL5|RX5|UART5 (ESC Telemetry)|
|SERIAL6|TX6/RX6|UART6|
|SERIAL7|TX7/RX7|UART7|

## RC Input

RC input is configured on the (UART2_RX/UART2_TX) pins which forms part of the DJI connector. It supports all serial RC protocols.

## OSD Support

The BLITZ H7 Pro supports OSD using OSD_TYPE 1 (MAX7456 driver).

## PWM Output

The BLITZ H7 Pro has 13 PWM outputs. The pads for motor output M1-M4 are in one ESC connector and M5-M8 in the second ESC connector. The remaining outputs are on the pads on the daughterboard. The first 8 outputs support bi-directional DShot and DShot, as well as all PWM types. Outputs 9-10 support DShot, as well as all PWM types and outputs 11-12 only support PWM.

The PWM are in in five groups:

 - PWM 1-2 in group1
 - PWM 3-6 in group2
 - PWM 7-10 in group3
 - PWM 11-12 in group4
 - PWM 13 in group5
.. note:: for users migrating from BetaflightX quads, the first four outputs M1-M4 have been configured for use with existing motor wiring using these default parameters:

- :ref:`FRAME_CLASS<FRAME_CLASS>` = 1 (Quad)
- :ref:`FRAME_TYPE<FRAME_TYPE>` = 12 (BetaFlightX)


Channels within the same group need to use the same output rate. If
any channel in a group uses DShot then all channels in the group need
to use DShot.

Video Power Control
================

The 12V video power can be turned off/on  using GPIO 81 which is already assigned by default to RELAY2.  This relay can be controlled either from the GCS or using a transmitter channel (See :ref:`common-auxiliary-functions`)
RSSI
====

Analog RSSI pin is "4"

## Battery Monitoring

The board has a builtin voltage sensor and a current sensor input tied to its 4 in 1 ESC current sensor. The voltage sensor can handle up to 6S
LiPo batteries.

The correct battery setting parameters are:

 - BATT_MONITOR 4
 - BATT_VOLT_PIN 10
 - BATT_VOLT_MULT 11
 - BATT_CURR_PIN 11
 - BATT_CURR_MULT 50

These are set by default in the firmware and shouldn't need to be adjusted

## Compass

The BLITZ H7 Pro does not have a builtin compass, but you can attach an external compass to I2C pins.

## Loading Firmware

Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the
bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the "with_bl.hex"
firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using
any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the
*.apj firmware files.
