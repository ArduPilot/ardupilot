 * fieldencode provides routines to place numbers into a byte stream.
 * 
 * fieldencode provides routines to place numbers in local memory layout into a
 * big or little endian byte stream. The byte stream is simply a sequence of
 * bytes, as might come from the data payload of a packet.
 * 
 * Support is included for non-standard types such as unsigned 24. When working
 * with nonstandard types the data in memory are given using the next larger
 * standard type. For example an unsigned 24 is actually a uint32_t in which
 * the most significant byte is clear, and only the least significant three
 * bytes are placed into a byte stream
 * 
 * Big or Little Endian refers to the order that a computer architecture will
 * place the bytes of a multi-byte word into successive memory locations. For
 * example the 32-bit number 0x01020304 can be placed in successive memory
 * locations in Big Endian: [0x01][0x02][0x03][0x04]; or in Little Endian:
 * [0x04][0x03][0x02][0x01]. The names "Big Endian" and "Little Endian" come
 * from Swift's Gulliver's travels, referring to which end of an egg should be
 * opened. The choice of name is made to emphasize the degree to which the
 * choice of memory layout is un-interesting, as long as one stays within the
 * local memory.
 * 
 * When transmitting data from one computer to another that assumption no
 * longer holds. In computer-to-computer transmission there are three endians
 * to consider: the endianness of the sender, the receiver, and the protocol
 * between them. A protocol is Big Endian if it sends the most significant byte
 * first and the least significant last. If the computer and the protocol have
 * the same endianness then encoding data from memory into a byte stream is a
 * simple copy. However if the endianness is not the same then bytes must be
 * re-ordered for the data to be interpreted correctly.
