# LUA Applets

Unlike the code in the examples directory, these are complete applets that required no user editing of the file for use. Each one has an .md file describing its operation and any switches or parameters in ArduPilot that are required for operation. The user only has to copy the applet to APM/scripts directory on their SD card, in order to install. Of course, scripting must be enabled via SCR_ENABLE =1 and the autopilot be capable of running scripts. See the Wiki for Lua Scripting under Advanced Configuration.

Each will have a Wiki entry mirroring the .md file'd contents with a link back to this directory.
