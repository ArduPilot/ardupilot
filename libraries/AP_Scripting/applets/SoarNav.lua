SoarNav: an advanced feature for hunting thermals by Marco Robustini.
-- Version 0.9.8.2 - 2025/08/13

SoarNav is an advanced Lua script for intelligent, autonomous soaring
that enhances ArduPilot's capabilities. It uses a suite of strategic
features to maximize flight time within a defined area.

The script employs a hybrid exploration strategy, dynamically balancing
the search for new grid cells with guided re-visiting of the least
explored areas based on recent thermal success. This is coupled with an
intelligent thermal memory that saves thermal core locations. A
sophisticated clustering algorithm then identifies promising hot zones
using a weighted score based on nearby thermals' strength, age, and
proximity.

Real-time thermal analysis is performed using adaptive sampling for a
responsive strength calculation. The script is architected for robust
performance with a modular state machine and parameter caching. Safety
is enhanced with dynamic anti-stuck logic, tactical rerouting, and
thermal street detection capabilities.

================================================================================
Key Features
================================================================================

- **Hybrid Exploration Strategy (Virtual Grid)**:
  Employs a dual-mode grid search, dynamically alternating between
  **Guided Exploration** (re-visiting the least-explored cells) and
  **Pure Exploration** (seeking new, unvisited cells) based on recent
  thermal success.

- **Efficient & Optimized**:
  The script is optimized to reduce CPU load by leveraging native ArduPilot
  APIs, a modular state machine, and parameter caching.

- **Advanced Thermal Analysis (Strength & Quality)**:
  Utilizes **Adaptive Sampling** (a weighted EMA based on climb rate) to
  rapidly and accurately calculate a thermal's average strength, peak
  strength, and **consistency** (steady vs. variable lift).

- **Intelligent Thermal Memory (Core, Clustering & Focus Mode)**:
  Saves not just the entry point but the **thermal core** (location of
  strongest lift) for greater accuracy. A sophisticated **clustering**
  algorithm identifies "hot zones" using a weighted score of nearby
  thermals' strength, age, and proximity. Can engage a **Focus Mode** to
  search high-density areas.

- **Energy-Aware & Dual-Strategy Decision Making**:
  Uses a **time-corrected low-pass filter** on normalized altitude to
  determine energy state, ensuring smooth and stable transitions between
  NORMAL, LOW, and CRITICAL states.

- **Thermal Streeting (Pattern Recognition)**:
  Instead of treating thermals as isolated events, the script attempts
  to identify **"thermal streets"**—lines of lift aligned with the wind to
  proactively search along the projected street axis.

- **Dynamic Thermal Drift Prediction**:
  Uses the current wind vector and a hotspot's age to predict its new,
  drifted position, increasing the chances of a successful intercept.

- **Safety & Tactical Navigation**:
  Includes pre-flight parameter validation, robust and **dynamic
  anti-stuck logic** that increases repositioning distance and varies the
  upwind angle on subsequent attempts, and a tactical mid-flight re-route.

- **Adaptive Waypoint Timeout**:
  Intelligently adjusts the time allowed to reach a waypoint based on
  current wind conditions, allowing more time in strong headwinds.

- **Intuitive Pilot Override & Stick Gestures**:
  - **Temporary Override**: Pitch or Yaw input instantly pauses
    autonomous navigation.
  - **Persistent Override (Roll Gesture)**: A rapid roll gesture toggles a
    persistent manual override.
  - **Dynamic Area Re-centering (Pitch Gesture)**: A rapid pitch gesture
    re-centers the circular search area to the aircraft's current location.

- **Dual Area System (Radius or Polygon)**:
  Supports both a circular area and a custom polygon loaded from the SD card.
  The SNAV_ENABLE parameter allows selection of multiple polygon files.

- **Advanced Logging System**:
  A multi-level logging system provides clear operational feedback, from
  key events to detailed real-time status for debugging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Script Parameters (SNAV_*)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SNAV_ENABLE: Master switch and Polygon Selector. 0:Disabled. >0:Enabled.
  When SNAV_MAX_DIST is 0, this value also selects the polygon file to use
  (e.g., 1 for snav1.poly, 2 for snav2.poly, up to 9). If the selected number
  is out of range or the file is invalid, the script will automatically
  load the lowest-numbered available polygon (e.g., snav1.poly) as a safe
  fallback.
- SNAV_LOG_LVL: Sets the verbosity level for GCS messages (0:Silent, 1:Events,
  2:Detailed).
- SNAV_MAX_DIST: Radius in meters of the circular flight area (0 for polygon).
- SNAV_ROLL_LIMIT: Maximum roll angle in degrees for navigation.
- SNAV_WP_RADIUS: Acceptance radius in meters for waypoints.
- SNAV_NAV_P / SNAV_NAV_D: Gains for the PD navigation controller.
- SNAV_TMEM_ENABLE: Enables (1) or disables (0) the Thermal Memory feature.
- SNAV_TMEM_LIFE: Lifetime in seconds of a stored thermal hotspot.
- SNAV_STUCK_EFF: Minimum path efficiency to not be considered "stuck".
  Higher is more sensitive.
- SNAV_STUCK_TIME: Grace time in seconds before anti-stuck logic becomes active.
- SNAV_REENG_DWELL: Time in seconds to loiter at a re-engagement point before
  aborting.
- SNAV_RETRY_THR: Score threshold (0-100) to trigger a retry on a weak thermal.
  Lower is more aggressive.
- SNAV_STREET_TOL: Angle tolerance in degrees for detecting a thermal street.
- SNAV_REROUTE_P: Probability (%) of a mid-flight tactical reroute. Higher is
  more opportunistic.
- SNAV_NEC_WEIGHT: Weight of the 'necessity' factor (low altitude) in the retry
  score.
- SNAV_TMEM_MIN_S: Minimum thermal strength (m/s) to be saved to memory.
- SNAV_FOCUS_THR: Density score threshold to trigger Focus Mode.
- SNAV_STRAT_HIST: Time window (s) for thermal success history to influence
  strategy.
- SNAV_WP_TIMEOUT: Base time in seconds to reach a waypoint before timeout.
- SNAV_REROUTE_MIN: Minimum angle in degrees for a tactical reroute maneuver.
- SNAV_REROUTE_MAX: Maximum angle in degrees for a tactical reroute maneuver.
- SNAV_DYN_SOALT: Controls the Glide Cone behavior. 0:Disabled, 1:Fully Linked
  (MIN/CUTOFF/MAX), 2:MIN Only (capped at 2/3 of CUTOFF).
- SNAV_GC_MARGIN: Safety altitude margin added on top of the calculated glide
  altitude for the Glide Cone feature.
- SNAV_GC_PAD: Extra altitude padding to ensure arrival over the home point,
  not at ground level, for the Glide Cone feature.

CHANGELOG / DEVELOPER NOTES
================================================================================
- v0.9.8.2 (2025/08/16): Major Tactical Re-route Overhaul & Hardening.
  The re-route maneuver is now calculated relative to the aircraft's current
  **heading (HDG)**, not the bearing to the old waypoint. This makes the
  maneuver a more intuitive and predictable tactical turn from the pilot's
  perspective. The logic was also hardened against transient nil values from
  the AHRS to prevent errors. The post-reroute search distance is now
  adaptive, scaling with both grid cell size and total flight area for
  more effective new waypoint selection.
- v0.9.8.1 (2025/08/15): Implemented Glide Cone and Robust Motor Failure Detection.
  Added a major safety feature ("Glide Cone") to prevent the script from flying
  too low for a safe, motor-off glide back home. This logic is fully
  configurable via the new SNAV_DYN_SOALT parameter to dynamically modulate
  soaring altitudes (MIN, CUTOFF, MAX) based on distance from home, and
  correctly restores boot values when autonomous navigation is paused.
  This version also introduces a critical Motor Failure Detection system with
  automatic RTL. Tightly integrated with the Glide Cone, this feature is
  active only when SNAV_DYN_SOALT is enabled, ensuring an RTL is only
  commanded when a safe glide return is possible. The system monitors for
  propulsion failure if the aircraft descends below SOAR_ALT_MIN and fails to
  establish a positive climb after a configurable delay. To maximize robustness
  and prevent false positives, the check is automatically suppressed in several
  key contexts: during Pilot Override, in THERMAL mode, within a dynamic
  safety bubble near home, and when the script is not in its primary
  NAVIGATING state. The logic is also resilient to dynamic changes in the
  SOAR_ALT_MIN threshold and requires both a low climb rate and a failure to
  gain altitude before triggering, making it robust against turbulence.
- v0.9.8.0 (2025/08/13): Major User Tunability Overhaul & GCS Alerting Refinements.
  Converted key algorithm constants into thirteen new tunable SNAV_* parameters,
  giving the pilot direct control over the script's core behavior.
  Added parameters for Anti-Stuck (SNAV_STUCK_EFF, SNAV_STUCK_TIME), Thermal
  Strategy (SNAV_RETRY_THR, SNAV_NEC_WEIGHT, SNAV_REENG_DWELL, SNAV_TMEM_MIN_S,
  SNAV_FOCUS_THR, SNAV_STRAT_HIST), and Navigation (SNAV_STREET_TOL,
  SNAV_REROUTE_P, SNAV_WP_TIMEOUT, SNAV_REROUTE_MIN, SNAV_REROUTE_MAX).
  Reorganized GCS message severities for more intuitive pilot feedback
  (e.g., anti-stuck is now a WARNING). General code cleanup and correction
  of minor logical bugs and unused variables.
- v0.9.7.1 (2025/08/13): Final Code Hardening & Critical Navigation Fix.
  Corrected a critical navigation bug where a unit mismatch (radians vs.
  degrees) in the bearing calculation caused the aircraft to fly straight. The
  controller now correctly converts all units, restoring navigation.
  Corrected the RC roll override release mechanism to use the proper API
  value (0) during state transitions, preventing runtime errors. Hardened
  system roll limit fetching with a safe fallback and added a time hysteresis
  to the CRITICAL energy state trigger to prevent false alarms in turbulent
  air. Unified all bearing calculations to use the native ArduPilot API.
- v0.9.7 (2025/08/12): Major Reroute Logic Overhaul & Logging System Refinements.
  This is a significant update consolidating numerous bug fixes, strategic
  enhancements, and quality-of-life improvements.
  Overhauled the tactical reroute system for greater intelligence and
  robustness. The maneuver is now skipped for thermal targets only if the
  aircraft is not 'stuck'. Fixed a critical bug causing desynchronization
  of the unvisited cell list, widened the post-reroute search arc for
  better effectiveness, and added a safety guard-rail for nil targets.
  Significantly refined the GCS logging system to improve clarity and reduce
  noise. Suppressed repetitive Level 1 logs during Focus Mode and Re-Engage
  maneuvers, and re-leveled detailed thermal target messages to Level 2.
  Corrected a log synchronization bug on script startup and improved the
  clarity of pilot override and resume messages.
  Refactored the core navigation handler to eliminate one-cycle delays,
  ensuring immediate and reliable new waypoint selection after completions,
  timeouts, or reroutes.
  Increased user control by making the adaptive waypoint timeout logic fully
  parametric via constants. Improved internal code documentation for key
  features.
- v0.9.63 (2025/08/11): Scoring, Re-engagement & Altitude Safety.
  Added a two-leg re-engage maneuver (Fly-Out → Re-Entry) with a wind/age-drifted
  re-entry target and an optional dwell at Re-Entry (REENGAGE_DWELL_MS).
  Tactical reroute is skipped while re-engaging.
  The decision to retry a weak/uncertain thermal is now driven by a weighted
  score (uncertainty from thermal strength, necessity from energy/altitude).
  Added safety check to prevent thermal-seeking above SOAR_ALT_MAX, forcing
  a neutral grid search to align with ArduPilot's safety philosophy.
- v0.9.62 (2025/08/10): Addressed key logical bugs in thermal selection and
  exploration strategies.
  Ensured the selected hotspot from memory is correctly referenced, fixing the
  failed attempt tracking logic.
  Corrected thermal street projection to navigate downwind, aligning with
  expected meteorological behavior.
  Fixed mathematical error in random waypoint generation to provide uniform
  area exploration and prevent central clustering.
  Refined GCS logging to make 'LOW ENERGY' messages conditional to the actual
  energy state.
- v0.9.61 (2025/08/09): Fixed critical logical bugs to improve reliability and
  efficiency.
  Hotspot saving now correctly stores the wind vector present at thermal entry.
  Hardened the wind cache logic to prevent potential type errors during
  initialization.
  Corrected swapped height and width in grid creation for more efficient
  exploration.
  Unified thermal waypoint labels to fix a critical reroute skip bug.
- v0.9.60 (2025/08/07): Refactored main navigation handler into smaller
  functions.
  PD controller derivative term is now time-corrected (uses dt).
  Improved hotspot selection to be deterministic instead of random tournament.
  Moved hardcoded "magic numbers" to SoarNavConstants.
  Cleaned up unused variables and comment formatting.
- v0.9.59 (2025/08/05): Major architectural refactoring.
  Implemented modular state machine for better readability and maintenance.
  Fixed memory leak by merging thermal entry timestamps into hotspot objects.
  Added parameter caching in main loop to reduce overhead.
- v0.9.58 (2025/08/05): Major algorithmic and logic enhancements.
  Implemented hybrid grid exploration (guided/random) based on success rate.
  Introduced dual-mode roll smoothing based on param sign.
  Replaced energy state logic with a time-corrected low-pass filter.
  Overhauled thermal density calculation to a weighted score model.
  Implemented adaptive thermal sampling using a weighted EMA.
  Enhanced anti-stuck logic with dynamic repositioning.
- v0.9.57 (2025/08/05): Added 90-degree reroute logic for tactical reroutes.
  100% compliant with Lua checker.
- v0.9.56 (2025/08/04): Implemented high-impact optimizations: Bounding box
  check for polygons, debounced (distance-based) grid cell updates, and
  pre-calculation of grid cell centers for faster waypoint selection.
- v0.9.55 (2025/08/04): Introduced Focus Mode; upon detecting a thermal
  cluster, the script now concentrates its search in a high-density sub-grid.
  The Cluster Radius is now dynamic, scaling with the flight area's size.
  Implemented Lost Thermal-Awareness to force grid exploration after
  consecutive failed attempts.
- v0.9.54 (2025/08/04): Implemented Thermal Core Estimation to save the
  location of the strongest lift, not just the entry point. Added Thermal
  Clustering logic to prioritize exploring areas with a high density of
  previously found thermals.
- v0.9.53 (2025/08/03): Added multi-polygon file selection via SNAV_ENABLE.
  Maximum cell values, cell size and default wp radius remodeled.
- v0.9.52 (2025/08/03): Added "Thermal Streeting" pattern recognition logic to
  proactively search for thermals along wind lines. Refactored waypoint
  selection logic for cleaner integration. Updated header description.
- v0.9.51 (2025/08/02): Added Mid-flight Tactical Re-route feature, shortened
  all GCS log messages, corrected thermal direction drift, minor cosmetic fix.
- v0.9.41 (2025/08/01): Fixed a critical logic bug in the anti-stuck feature
  where the script would not re-engage the original waypoint after completing
  an upwind repositioning maneuver.
- v0.9.4 (2025/07/31): Major refactoring to leverage native ArduPilot APIs
  (e.g., Location objects, get_distance, offset_bearing) instead of manual
  Lua calculations.
- v0.9.2 (2025/07/29): Initial version published with manual geospatial
  calculations.
