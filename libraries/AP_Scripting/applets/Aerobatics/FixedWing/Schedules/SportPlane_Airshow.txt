# Many sport "3D" planes are
# perfectly capable of aerobatics including sustained
# knife-edges and have the ability to do loops and immelmans
# and even hovers.
# However, maintaining precise earth reference trajectories
# while doing vertical tricks can result in stalls or aborts
# of the schedule, especially in even relatively light wind.
# This schedule is almost entirely horizontal (constant altitude) tricks
# and only uses the half-reverse-cuban-eight as the turn-around 
# at each end and moderate climbing manuovers since they require minimal
# sustained vertical power
