#LUA Examples


This directory contains some script examples. For simulation the scripts should be placed in the simulation's "scripts" directory located in the root directory from which the sim is run.
Note: if an example uses auxillary files (mission list, other scripts,etc.) the user will have to determine where the files should be placed from the script. If no path name is specified in the file name, then it should be placed one directory level above the "scripts" directory.
