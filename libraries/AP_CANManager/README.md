## Testing And Debugging

**Testing under SITL**

A wide range of DroneCAN peripherals are supported in the SITL
simulation system. The simplest way of starting a DroneCAN enabled
simulated vehicle is to use sim_vehicle.py.

For a quadplane use: sim_vehicle.py with the option -f quadplane-can

For a quadcopter use: sim_vehicle.py with the option -f quad-can
