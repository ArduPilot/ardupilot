  GPS detection state structures. These need to be in a separate
  header to prevent a circular dependency between AP_GPS and the
  backend drivers.

  These structures are allocated as a single block in AP_GPS during
  driver detection, then freed once the detection is finished. Each
  GPS driver needs to implement a static _detect() function which uses
  this state information to detect if the attached GPS is of the
  specific type that it handles.
