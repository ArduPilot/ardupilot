/*
* This object generates a chirp signal based on the input variables.  A chirp is
* a sine wave starting from the minimum frequency and ending at the maximum frequency.
* The progression in frequency is not linear but designed to increase exponentially.
* The chirp can be designed to dwell at the minimum frequency for a specified time
* before sweeping through the frequencies and also can fade in the magnitude at the
* beginning and fade out the magnitude at the end.  This object can also generate
* constant frequency sine waves by setting the minimum and maximum frequency to the
* same value.
