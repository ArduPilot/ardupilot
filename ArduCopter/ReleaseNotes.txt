------------------------------------------------------------------
Copter 3.3-rc8 25-Jul-2015
Changes from 3.3-rc7
1) EKF improvements:
    a) de-weight accelerometers that are clipping to improve resistance to high vibration
    b) fix EKF to use primary compass instead of first compass (normally the same)
2) UBlox "HDOP" corrected to actually be hdop (was pdop) which leads to 40% lower value reported
3) TradHeli:
    a) Motors library split into "Multicopter" and "TradHeli" so TradHeli does not see multicopter parameters
    b) Heading target reset during landing to reduce vehicle fighting to rotate while on the ground
4) Minor enhancements:
    a) SToRM32 gimbal can be connected to any serial port

------------------------------------------------------------------
Copter 3.3-rc4 17-May-2015
Changes from 3.3-rc3
1) AutoTune:
    a) save roll, pitch, yaw rate acceleration limits along with gains
    b) more conservative gains 
2) Roll, pitch rate control feed-forward now on by default (set ATC_RATE_FF_ENAB to "0" to disable)
3) Serial ports increased to maximum of 4 (set SERIALX_PROTOCOL to 1)

    b) bug fix preventing external selection of optical flow mode
6) Parachute:
    a) servo/relay held open for 2sec when deploying (was 1sec)

Changes from 3.3-rc1
1) AutoTune reliability fixes (improved filtering to reduce noise interference)
2) Optical flow improvements:
    a) Range Finder pre-arm check - lift vehicle between 50cm ~ 2m before arming.  Can be disabled by setting ARMING_CHECK to "Skip Params/Sonar"
    b) Vehicle altitude limited to range finder altitude when optical flow is enabled 
3) AltHold & Take-off changes:
    a) feed-forward controller and jerk limiting should result in slightly snappier performance and smoother take-offs
    b) vehicle climbs automatically to PILOT_TKOFF_ALT alt when taking off in Loiter, AltHold, PosHold, Sport (disabled by default, pilot's throttle input overrides takeoff)
    c) PILOT_THR_FILT allows enforcing smoother throttle response in manual flight modes (defaults to 0 = off)
    d) TX with sprung throttle can set PILOT_THR_BHV to "1" so motor feedback when landed starts from mid-stick instead of bottom of stick
    e) GCS can initiate takeoff even in Loiter, AltHold, PosHold and sport by issuing NAV_TAKEOFF mavlink command
4) Stop flight mode - causes vehicle to stop quickly, and does not respond to user input or waypoint movement via MAVLink.  Requires GPS, will be renamed to Brake mode.
5) Aux channel features:
    a) Emergency Stop - stops all motors immediately and disarms in 5 seconds
    b) Motor Interlock - opposite of Emergency Stop, must be on to allow motors to spin motors, must be off to arm
6) Air pressure gain scaling (of roll, pitch, yaw) should mostly remove need to re-tune when flying at very different altitudes
7) landing detector simplified to only check vehicle is not accelerating & motors have hit their lower limit
8) Loiter tuning params to remove "freight train" stops:
       raising WPNAV_LOIT_MAXA makes vehicle start and stop faster
       raising WPNAV_LOIT_MINA makes vehicle stop more quickly when sticks centered 
9) Other items:
    a) faster EKF startup
    b) Camera control messages sent via MAVLink to smart cameras.  Allow control of camera zoom for upcoming IntelEdison/Sony QX1 camera control board
    c) Lost Copter Alarm can be triggered by holding throttle down, roll right, pitch back
10) Bug fixes:
    a) Home position set to latest arm position (it was being set to previous disarm location or first GPS lock position)
    b) bug fix to mission Jump to command zero
------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Safety Items:
    a) Baro glitch check relaxed to 5m distance, 15m/s/s max acceleration
    b) EKF/INav check relaxed to 80cm/s/s acceleration correct (default remains as 0.6 but this now means 80cm/s/s)

       When EKF is not used inertial nav's accelerometer corrections are used as a substitute

       When glitching occurs barometer values are temporarily ignored
    c) Throttle/radio and battery failsafes now disarm vehicle when landed regardless of pilot's throttle position

3) Drift mode uses "throttle assist" for altitude control (Jason)
4) Extended Kalman Filter for potentially more reliable attitude and position control (Pixhawk only) (Paul Riseborough).  Set AHRS_EKF_USE to 1 to enable or use Ch7/8 switch to enable/disable in flight.
