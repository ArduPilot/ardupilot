 Attitude Rate controller thread design.

 Rationale: running rate outputs linked to fast gyro outputs achieves two goals:

 1. High frequency gyro processing allows filters to be applied with high sample rates
    which is advantageous in removing high frequency noise and associated aliasing
 2. High frequency rate control reduces the latency between control and action leading to 
    better disturbance rejection and faster responses which generally means higher
    PIDs can be used without introducing control oscillation

 (1) is already mostly achieved through the higher gyro rates that are available via
 INS_GYRO_RATE. (2) requires running the rate controller at higher rates via a separate thread


 Goal: the ideal scenario is to run in a single cycle:

    gyro read->filter->publish->rate control->motor output

 This ensures the minimum latency between gyro sample and motor output. Other functions need 
 to also run faster than they would normally most notably logging and filter frequencies - most
 notably the harmonic notch frequency.

 Design assumptions:

 1. The sample rate of the IMUs is consistent and accurate.
    This is the most basic underlying assumption. An alternative approach would be to rely on
    the timing of when samples are received but this proves to not work in practice due to
    scheduling delays. Thus the dt used by the attitude controller is the delta between IMU
    measurements, not the delta between processing cycles in the rate thread.
 2. Every IMU reading must be processed or consistently sub-sampled.
    This is an assumption that follows from (1) - so it means that attitude control should
    process every sample or every other sample or every third sample etc. Note that these are
    filtered samples - all incoming samples are processed for filtering purposes, it is only
    for the purposes of rate control that we are sub-sampling.
 3. The data that the rate loop requires is timely, consistent and accurate.
    Rate control essentially requires two components - the target and the actuals. The actuals
    come from the incoming gyro sample combined with the state of the PIDs. The target comes
    from attitude controller which is running at a slower rate in the main loop. Since the rate
    thread can read the attitude target at any time it is important that this is always available
    consistently and is updated consistently.
 4. The data that the rest of the vehicle uses is the same data that the rate thread uses.
    Put another way any gyro value that the vehicle uses (e.g. in the EKF etc), must have already
    been processed by the rate thread. Where this becomes important is with sub-sampling - if 
    rate gyro values are sub-sampled we need to make sure that the vehicle is also only using
    the sub-sampled values.

 Design:

 1. Filtered gyro samples are (sub-sampled and) pushed into an ObjectBuffer from the INS backend.
 2. The pushed sample is published to the INS front-end so that the rest of the vehicle only
    sees published values that have been used by the rate controller. When the rate thread is not 
    in use the filtered samples are effectively sub-sampled at the main loop rate. The EKF is unaffected
    as it uses delta angles calculated from the raw gyro values. (It might be possible to avoid publishing
    from the rate thread by only updating _gyro_filtered when a value is pushed).
 3. A notification is sent that a sample is available
 4. The rate thread is blocked waiting for a sample. When it receives a notification it:
    4a. Runs the rate controller
    4b. Pushes the new pwm values. Periodically at the main loop rate all of the SRV_Channels::push()
        functionality is run as well.
 5. The rcout dshot thread is blocked waiting for a new pwm value. When it is signalled by the
    rate thread it wakes up and runs the dshot motor output logic.
 6. Periodically the rate thread:
    6a. Logs the rate outputs (1Khz)
    6b. Updates the notch filter centers (Gyro rate/2)
    6c. Checks the ObjectBuffer length and main loop delay (10Hz)
        If the ObjectBuffer length has been longer than 2 for the last 5 cycles or the main loop has
        been slowed down then the rate thread is slowed down by telling the INS to sub-sample. This
        mechanism is continued until the rate thread is able to keep up with the sub-sample rate.
        The inverse of this mechanism is run if the rate thread is able to keep up but is running slower
        than the gyro sample rate.
    6d. Updates the PID notch centers (1Hz)
 7. When the rate rate changes through sub-sampling the following values are updated:
    7a. The PID notch sample rate
    7b. The dshot rate is constrained to be never greater than the gyro rate or rate rate
    7c. The motors dt
 8. Independently of the rate thread the attitude control target is updated in the main loop. In order
    for target values to be consistent all updates are processed using local variables and the final
    target is only written at the end of the update as a vector. Direct control of the target (e.g. in
    autotune) is also constrained to be on all axes simultaneously using the new desired value. The
    target makes use of the current PIDs and the "latest" gyro, it might be possible to use a loop
    delayed gyro value, but that is currently out-of-scope.

 Performance considerations:

 On an H754 using ICM42688 and gyro sampling at 4KHz and rate thread at 4Khz the main CPU users are:

 ArduCopter    PRI=182 sp=0x30000600 STACK=4392/7168 LOAD=18.6%
 idle          PRI=  1 sp=0x300217B0 STACK= 296/ 504 LOAD= 4.3%
 rcout         PRI=181 sp=0x3001DAF0 STACK= 504/ 952 LOAD=10.7%
 SPI1          PRI=181 sp=0x3002DAB8 STACK= 856/1464 LOAD=17.5%
 SPI4          PRI=181 sp=0x3002D4A0 STACK= 888/1464 LOAD=18.3%
 rate          PRI=182 sp=0x3002B1D0 STACK=1272/1976 LOAD=22.4%

 There is a direct correlation between the rate rate and CPU load, so if the rate rate is half the gyro
 rate (i.e. 2Khz) we observe the following:

 ArduCopter    PRI=182 sp=0x30000600 STACK=4392/7168 LOAD=16.7%
 idle          PRI=  1 sp=0x300217B0 STACK= 296/ 504 LOAD=21.3%
 rcout         PRI=181 sp=0x3001DAF0 STACK= 504/ 952 LOAD= 6.2%
 SPI1          PRI=181 sp=0x3002DAB8 STACK= 856/1464 LOAD=16.7%
 SPI4          PRI=181 sp=0x3002D4A0 STACK= 888/1464 LOAD=17.8%
 rate          PRI=182 sp=0x3002B1D0 STACK=1272/1976 LOAD=11.5%

 So we get almost a halving of CPU load in the rate and rcout threads. This is the main way that CPU
 load can be handled on lower-performance boards, with the other mechanism being lowering the gyro rate.
 So at a very respectable gyro rate and rate rate both of 2Khz (still 5x standard main loop rate) we see:

 ArduCopter    PRI=182 sp=0x30000600 STACK=4440/7168 LOAD=15.6%
 idle          PRI=  1 sp=0x300217B0 STACK= 296/ 504 LOAD=39.4%
 rcout         PRI=181 sp=0x3001DAF0 STACK= 504/ 952 LOAD= 5.9%
 SPI1          PRI=181 sp=0x3002DAB8 STACK= 856/1464 LOAD= 8.9%
 SPI4          PRI=181 sp=0x3002D4A0 STACK= 896/1464 LOAD= 9.1%
 rate          PRI=182 sp=0x30029FB0 STACK=1296/1976 LOAD=11.8%

 This essentially means that its possible to run this scheme successfully on all MCUs by careful setting of 
 the maximum rates.

 Enabling rate thread timing debug for 4Khz reads with fast logging and armed we get the following data:

 Rate loop timing: gyro=178us, rate=13us, motors=45us, log=7us, ctrl=1us
 Rate loop timing: gyro=178us, rate=13us, motors=45us, log=7us, ctrl=1us
 Rate loop timing: gyro=177us, rate=13us, motors=46us, log=7us, ctrl=1us

 The log output is an average since it only runs at 1Khz, so roughly 28us elapsed. So the majority of the time
 is spent waiting for a gyro sample (higher is better here since it represents the idle time) updating the PIDs
 and outputting to the motors. Everything else is relatively cheap. Since the total cycle time is 250us the duty
 cycle is thus 29%
